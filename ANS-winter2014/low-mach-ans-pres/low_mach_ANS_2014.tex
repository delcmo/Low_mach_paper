\item 6-equation two-phase flow model with time- and volume-averaged equations. The 6-eq model is ill-posed (non hyperbolic) and needs artificial viscosity and surface tension to be well-posed.
\item Semi-implicit in time with staggered spatial grids (momentum grid half-shifted from the mass/energy grid)

\subsection{Basic Idea}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{Quick overview of the entropy-based artificial viscosity formalism}

General scalar conservation law: $\partial_t u + \div \vec{f}(u) = 0$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine an entropy pair ($s(u),\, \vec{\Psi}(u)$) for the PDE under consideration
\item Compute the entropy residual $R_e:=\partial_t s(u_h) + \div \Psi(u_h)$, in each cell $K$, at each quadrature point $x_q$
\item Compute the speed associated with this residual
\be
v_e := h \frac{|R_e(x_q)|_K}{|s-\overline{s}|_\infty}
\ee
%The denominator is used to normalize the residual
%. It is the deviation of $E(u)$ from the domain average $\overline{E}$.
\item Define the dynamic viscosity (m$^2$/s) as
\be
\mu := h \min \Big( \frac{1}{2} |\vec{f}'(u)|, \, v_e \Big)
\ee
\item Plug in the standard Galerkin weak form as a \tcm{viscous regularization} %(\tcm{it is really a straightforward technique})
\be
\int_V \big( \partial_t u_h + \div \vec{f}(u_h) \big) b \, dx + \tcm{\sum_K \int_K \mu_K \grad u_h \grad b \, dx} = 0 \quad \forall b
\ee

\section{Extension of the Entropy Viscosity Method to Low-Mach Flows}

\subsection{New Formulation of the Entropy Residual}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{Low-Mach studies: New formulation for the entropy residual}

Recall that 

\begin{equation}
\mu^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t) =  h_K^2 \frac{|\resi^K(\vec{r}_q,t) |}{|| s - \bar{s} ||_\infty}  
\qquad
\kappa^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t) = \Pr \, \mu^K_e(\vec{r}_q,t)
\end{equation}


\begin{block}{Issues with current formulation in the low-Mach limit}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the low-Mach Regime, the flow is known to be \textcolor{red}{isentropic}, resulting in very little entropy production
\item In practice, the entropy residual $\resi$ will be very small in that regime  (i.e., small numerator in the expression for the viscosity coefficients)
\item and so will be the denominator $|| s - \bar{s} ||_\infty$,
\item Thus, the formula for the viscosity coefficients are not determined \textcolor{red}{(ill-scaled) in the low-Mach limit}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{Alternate definition of the entropy residual}

%We can show that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ent_res}
\resi(\vec{r},t) := \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \grad s = \matder{s} = \frac{s_e}{P_e} \underbrace{\left( \matder{P} - c^2 \matder{\rho} \right)}_{\resinew(\vec{r},t)} 
\end{equation} 

%Idea for the demonstration: 
%$s$ is a function of $e$ and $\rho$, thus $\matder{s} = s_e\matder{e} + s_\rho \matder{\rho}$\\
%Re-express the internal energy $e$ as a function of $P$ and $\rho$ through the EoS.

\begin{block}{Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
\item The entropy residuals $\resi$ and $\resinew$ are proportional to one another %and will experience similar variations in space and time. 
\item Thus, one may elect to employ $\resinew$ instead of $\resi$ %for the evaluation of the local entropy residual.
\item {\it An analytical expression of the entropy function $s$ is no longer needed} %: the residual $\resinew$ is evaluated using the local values of $P\,,\rho\,,u\,,c$ %pressure, density, velocity and speed of sound.
\item \textcolor{red}{Suitable normalizations for the residual} $\resinew$ can be devised (e.g., $P$, $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ or $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$)%. Examples include the pressure itself or combinations of the density, the speed of sound and the norm of the velocity, i.e., $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ or $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


\begin{block}{What is the proper normalization for $\resinew(\vec{r},t)$?}
Requirements
\begin{enumerate}
\item To recover the incompressible results in the low-Mach limit %(i.e., pressure fluctuations $\propto M^2$; divergence-free flow; incompressible continuity equation)
\item To remain valid and accurate for supersonic flows
\end{enumerate}
\textcolor{red}{Asymptotic analysis} to determine the proper scaling in the low-Mach limit.

\frametitle{Bridging the gap from low-Mach to supersonic}

\begin{block}{Answer from low-Mach asymptotic study}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}

%\begin{block}{The model}
%\begin{itemize}
%%\setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}
%\item A single $1$-D channel % pipe of cross section $A=7.845 \times 10^{-5}$ $m^2$ and length $L = 3.865$ $m$.
%\item Wall friction, gravity, and wall heat source $Q_w = h_t a_w (T_{liq} - T_w)$ % with $h_t = 5.33 \times 10^4$ $W/m$, $a_w = 2.82$ $mm$.
%\item Wall temperature $T_w$ is a function of height %and computed from the model available in RELAP-7: fuel, gap and clad with a constant power $P = 7.7 \times 10^3$ $kW / m^3$.
%\item Inlet BC: specify total enthalpy ($H$) and momentum ($\rho u$).
%\item Outlet BC: static pressure boundary with $P_s = 155$ $bar$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{block}
%
%\begin{block}{Discretization}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Second-order accurate implicit temporal integrator (BDF2).
%\item Linear Lagrange finite elements
%\item Simulation run to steady state with a CFL of $100$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{block}
%
%\begin{block}{Stabilization methods used}
%%The code is run with three different stabilization methods for comparison:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item entropy-viscosity method (EV).
%\item SUPG.
%\item first-order viscosity, i.e. $\mu = \mu_{max}$ (FO).
%\end{itemize}
