%%%%%% More vertical space can be added here %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Please find attached a copy of our manuscript titled 
``Entropy-based viscous regularization for the multi-dimensional Euler equations in low-Mach and transonic flows'' 
for submission to {\em 
Computers \& Fluids}. 

In this paper, we propose  aaa. 


This work follows closely prior works by aaa adn extend them to aaaa.

Our work is based on aaa.

Several test cases, taken from the literature on discretizations of the aaa.

Employing a CFEM approximation to solve the aaa.



Thank you for considering this manuscript for publication in JCP.
