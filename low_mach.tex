\begin{abstract}
The entropy viscosity method, introduced by Guermond et al. \cite{jlg1, jlg2}, is extended to the multi-dimensional Euler equations for both subsonic (very low Mach numbers) and supersonic flows. 
We show that the current definition of the viscosity coefficients \cite{jlg1, jlg2} is not adapted to low-Mach flows and we provide a robust alternate definition valid for any Mach number value. The new definitions are derived from a low-Mach asymptotic study. 
In addition, the entropy minimum principle is used to derive the viscous regularization terms for Euler equations with variable area for nozzle flow problems. 
Various $1$- and $2$-D numerical tests are presented : flow in a convergent-divergent nozzle, Leblanc shock tube, slow moving shock, subsonic flow around a $2$-D cylinder and over a circular hump, and supersonic flow in a compression corner. Convergence studies are performed using analytical solutions in $1$-D. 
The ideal gas and stiffened gas equations of state are employed. \tcr{is there a better name, that would let the reader understand this is for liquid as well?}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

%\tcr{I think we should focus the introduction more}
%
%Incompressible flows are a particular case of compressible ones and therefore in principle, a
%compressible flow solver should be able to compute these flows. Unfortunately, there are experimental
%evidences showing that on a fixed mesh, the solutions of the compressible flow discretized
%equations are not an accurate approximation of the solutions of the incompressible model (e.g. see
%[29]). A first analysis of this problem appeared in [23] and this question has drawn a considerable
%attention [1–3,7,9,26,28,30] in the recent past. Several works have tried to explain the reasons of
%this difficulty and to construct numerical schemes valid for all Mach numbers. Some of these
%works extend to the compressible regime the numerical methods used for the computation of
%incompressible flows. Examples of these type of methods are for instance [1] or [30]. Another
%approaches rely on some modifications of high order shock capturing techniques. These approaches
%are for instance described in [2,7,22] for Roe discretization, in [3] for the HLLE scheme
%and in [28] for Flux schemes. Their principal ingredient is the use of preconditioning techniques
%originally developed for steady state computations [4,21,23] that are here selectively applied only
%to the upwind artificial viscosity.
%
%
%The efficient simulation of low Mach number flows is a subject of ongoing discussion in the
%CFD community. While the flow is expected to be incompressible, in a lot of applications
%the Mach number or the compressibility properties vary strongly in time or space. This is
%for example the case in nozzle  flow, chemically reacting flows or laminar combustion. It is
%well known that purely compressible flow solvers which were developed for transonic 
%flow produce wrong results at low Mach numbers. On the other hand, standard incompressible 
%flow solvers cannot deal with strong temperature or strong density gradients. This sets a
%demand for codes that can deal with flows at all Mach numbers.
%
%It is well known that it is difficult to solve the compressible equations for low Mach numbers.
%For an explicit scheme this is easily seen by looking at the time steps. For stability the time
%step must be chosen inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the system which is
%approximately the speed of sound, c, for slow flows. However, other waves are convected at the
%fluid speed, u, which is much slower. Hence, these waves don’t change very much over a time
%step. Thus, thousands of time steps are required to reach a steady state. Should one try a
%multigrid acceleration one finds that the same disparity in wave speeds slows down the
%multigrid acceleration. With an implicit method an AD1 factorization is usually used so that
%one can easily invert the implicit factors. The use of AD1 introduces factorization errors which
%again slow down the convergence rate when there are wave speeds of very different magnitudes
%For small Mach numbers it can be shown [28,31] that the incompressible equations approximate
%the compressible equations. Hence, one needs to justify the use of the compressible
%equations for low Mach flows. We present several reasons why one would still use the
%compressible equations even though the Mach number of the flow is small.
%l There are many sophisticated compressible codes available that could be used for such
%problems especially in complicated geometries.
%l For low speed aerodynamic problems at a high angle of attack most of the flow consists of
%a low Mach number flow. However, there are localized regions containing shocks.
%l In many problems thermal effects are important and the energy equation is coupled to the
%other equations.
%
%The incompressible limit of a compressible flow is rather subtle due to the fact that the propagation rate of
%the pressure waves becomes infinite and the equations change their type. Within this limit the pressure splits up
%into a thermodynamic pressure term and a hydrodynamic pressure term. If the limit solution has constant
%temperature and density and if the boundary values satisfy the incompressibility constraint, then the
%thermodynamic pressure becomes the background pressure being constant in space and time. The hydrodynamic
%pressure appears in the incompressible equations as a sort of a Lagrangian multiplier with no connection
%to the equation of state. The asymptotic analysis of Klainerman and Majda in [9,10] gives insight into this
%limit behavior. They gave a mathematically rigorous derivation in the isentropic case. The asymptotic analysis
%was formally extended by Klein to the non-isentropic case and to multiple space scales in [11] in which he also
%gave an overview about other asymptotic considerations in this low Mach number regime. A detailed discussion
%of the incompressible limit is also given in the book of Wesseling [20].
%Numerical methods for the compressible equations may have difficulties with the zero Mach number limit
%because in the limit the speed of sound waves becomes infinite compared to the flow speed and thus leads to an
%elliptic coupling of pressure and velocity. Hence, all explicit numerical schemes become quite inefficient in the
%low Mach number regime due to their stability restriction (CFL condition). The other difficulty is that the
%pressure in the compressible equations converges to the thermodynamic pressure, which becomes the constant
%background pressure in the incompressible limit. This is the way how the equation of state for compressible
%flow is automatically satisfied and does not appear in the incompressible equations. For the compressible
%equations Bijl and Wesseling [2] introduced a splitting of the pressure into a thermodynamic and a hydrodynamic
%pressure term. Then they proposed an implicit numerical method that remains stable without reference
%to the sound velocity and which approximates the incompressible equations for Mach number zero. The constant
%thermodynamic pressure satisfies the equation of state and the hydrodynamic pressure serves as a
%Lagrangian multiplier to get the divergence-free property of the velocity. A formulation in conservative variables
%was later given in [18,20]. Similar to this approach Klein and Munz [12] and Munz et al. [13] proposed
%the multiple pressure variable (MPV) method based on the asymptotic results of Klein [11].

\tcr{above are good snippets from some papers.}

Over the past years an increasing interest raised for computational methods that can solve both compressible and incompressible flows. In engineering applications, there is often the need to solve for complex flows where a near incompressible regime or low Mach flow coexists with a supersonic flow domain. For example, such flow are encountered in aerodynamic in the study of airships. In the nuclear industry, flows are nearly the incompressible regime but compressible effects cannot be neglected because of the heat source and thus needs to be accurately resolved. \\
When solving the multi-D Euler equations for a wide range of Mach numbers, multiple problems have to address: stability, accuracy and acceleration of the convergence in the low Mach regime. Because of the hyperbolic nature of the equations, shocks can form during transonic and supersonic flows, and require the use of the numerical methods in order to stabilize the scheme and correctly resolve the discontinuities. The literature offers a wide range of stabilization methods: flux-limiter \cite{FluxLimiter, FluxLimiter2}, pressure-based viscosity method (\cite{PBV_book}), Lapidus method (\cite{Lapidus_paper, LMP, Lapidus_book}), and the entropy-viscosity method(\cite{jlg1, jlg2}) among others. These numerical methods are usually developed using simple equation of states and tested for transonic and supersonic flows where the disparity between the acoustic waves and the fluid speed is not large since the Mach number is of order one. This approach leads to a well-known accuracy problem in the low Mach regime where the fluid velocity is smaller that the speed of sound by multiple order of magnitude. The numerical dissipative terms become ill-scaled in the low Mach regime and lead to the wrong numerical solution by changing the nature of the equations solved. This behavior is well documented in the literature \cite{LowMach1, LowMach2, LowMach3} and often treated by performing a low Mach asymptotic study of the multi-D Euler equation. This method was originally used \cite{LowMach1} to show convergence of the compressible multi-D Euler equations to the incompressible ones. Thus, by using the same method, the effect of the dissipative terms in the low Mach regime, can be understood and, when needed, a fix is developed in order to ensure the convergence of the equations to the correct physical solution. This approach was used as a fixing method for multiple well known stabilization methods alike Roe scheme (\cite{Roe}) and SUPG \cite{LowMach3} while preserving the original stabilization properties of shocks.  \\
We propose, through this paper, to investigate how the entropy viscosity method, when applied to the multi-D Euler equations with variable area, behaves in the low Mach regime. This method was initially introduced by Guermond et al. to solve for the hyperbolic systems and has shown good results when used for solving the multi-D Euler equations with various discretization schemes. More importantly, it is simple to implement, can be used with unstructured grids,  and its dissipative terms are consistent with the entropy minimum principle and proven valid for any equation of state under certain conditions \cite{jlg}. \\
This paper is organized as follows: in \sct{sec:entro_visc} the current definition of the entropy viscosity method is recalled, and inconsistency with the low Mach regime are pointed out. Since our interest is in the variable area version of the multi-D Euler equation, the reader is guided trough the steps leading to the derivation of the dissipative terms on the model of \cite{jlg}. Then in \sct{sec:extension}, a new definition of the viscosity coefficient is introduced and derived from a low Mach asymptotic study. After detailing the spatial and temporal discretization method in \sct{sec:solution_tech}, $1$- and $2$-D numerical results are presented in \sct{sec:results} for a wide range of Mach numbers: low Mach flow over a cylinder and a circular bump, and supersonic flow in a compression corner \cite{CompressionCorner}. Convergence studies are performed in $1$-D, in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the solution. \\
\tcr{I wouldn't recall this here. Let me think about that.}\\
For purpose of clarity, the multi-D Euler equations with variable area are recalled in \eqt{eq:euler_eq} and the corresponding variables are defined:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euler_eq}
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{lll}
\partial_t \left( \rho A\right) + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} A\right) = 0\\
\partial_t \left( \rho \vec{u} A\right) + \div \left[ \left( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u} + P \mathbf{I} \right) A \right] = P \grad A\\
\partial_t \left( \rho E A\right) + \div \left[ \vec{u} \left( \rho E + P \right) A\right] = 0 \\
P = P\left( \rho, e \right)
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho$, $\rho \vec{u}$ and $\rho E$ are the density, the momentum and the total energy, respectively, and will be referred to as the conservative variables. The pressure $P$ is computed with an equation of state expressed in function of the density $\rho$ and the specific internal energy $e$. The tensor product $\vec{a} \otimes \vec{b}$ is taken with the following convention: $(\vec{a} \otimes \vec{b})_{i,j} = a_i b_j$. Lastly, the terms $\partial_t$, $\grad$, $\div$ and $\mathbf{I}$ denote the temporal derivative, the gradient and divergent operators, and the identity tensor, respectively. The variable area $A$ is assumed spatial dependent.

\section{The Entropy Viscosity Method} \label{sec:entro_visc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Background} \label{sec:background}
%===================================================================================================
In this section, the entropy viscosity method \cite{jlg1, jlg2, jlg3, valentin} is recalled for the multi-D Euler equations (with constant area $A$). The method consists of adding dissipative terms with a viscosity coefficient modulated by the entropy production; this allows for a high-order accuracy when the solution is smooth (provided that the spatial and temporal discretizations also are high order). 
The derivation of the viscous regularization (dissipative terms) is carried out to be consistent with the entropy minimum principle theorem; details of the derivation and proofs can be found in \cite{jlg}. The viscous regularization obtained is valid for any equation of state as long as the physical entropy function $s$ is such that $-s$ is a convex function with respect to the internal energy $e$ and the specific volume $1/\rho$. Euler equations with viscous regularization are recalled in \eqt{eq:euler_visc}:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:euler_visc}
%
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho  + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} \right) = \div \left( \kappa \grad \rho \right) 
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \left( \rho \vec{u} \right) + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u} + P \mathbf{I} \right) = \div \left( \mu \rho \grad^s \vec{u}  + \kappa \vec{u} \otimes \grad \rho \right)  
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \left( \rho E \right) + \div \left[ \vec{u} \left( \rho E + P \right) \right] = \div \left( \kappa \grad \left( \rho e \right) + \frac{1}{2}|| \vec{u} ||^2 \kappa \grad \rho +  \rho \mu \vec{u} \grad \vec{u}  \right) 
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
where $\kappa$ and $\mu$ are positive viscosity coefficients. $\grad^s \vec{u}$ denotes the symmetric gradient operator that guarantees the method to be rotationally invariant \cite{jlg}.

The viscous regularization (\eqt{eq:euler_visc}) requires the numerical computation of viscosity coefficients. Many stabilization approaches have been proposed in the literature such as the Lapidus (pressure-based) method \cite{Lapidus_book, Lapidus_paper}. Here, we follow the work of Guermond et al. and define the viscosity coefficients, $\kappa$ and $\mu$, based on the local entropy production. These coefficients are evaluated using the local entropy residual $D_e(\vec{r},t)$ defined in \eqt{eq:ent_residual}; $D_e(\vec{r},t)$ is known to be peaked in shocks and vanishingly small elsewhere \cite{Toro}. 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ent_residual}
D_e(\vec{r}, t) := \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \grad s
\end{equation}
%
In the current version of the method, $\kappa$ and $\mu$ are set equal but this is not mandatory. Since $D_e(\vec{r},t)$ can be extremely larger in shocks, the definition of the viscosity also includes a first-order viscosity coefficient that serves as upper bound for the entropy-based viscosity coefficients. The first-order viscosity coefficients, denoted by $\mu_{\max}$ and $\kappa_{\max}$, are chosen so that the numerical scheme becomes equivalent to the upwind scheme when the first-order coefficients are employed. The upwind scheme is known to be over-dissipative but guarantees monotonicity \cite{Toro}. In practice, the viscosity coefficients only saturate to the first-order viscosity coefficients in shocks and are much smaller elsewhere, hence avoiding over-dissipation due tot he upwind method.  The first-order viscosity coefficients $\mu_{\max}$ and $\kappa_{\max}$ are set proportional to the local largest eigenvalue $|| \vec{u} || + c $:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fo}
\mu_{\max}(\vec{r}, t) = \kappa_{\max}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{h}{2} \left( || \vec{u}(\vec{t,r}) || + c(\vec{t,r}) \right),
\end{equation}
%
where $h$ is the local grid size (for higher than linear finite element representations, $h$ is defined as the ratio of the grid size to the polynomial order of the test functions used, see \tcr{Eq. xx in \cite{jlg1}}). In practice, the quantities are evaluated within a given cell $K$ at quadrature points:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fo_quad}
\mu^K_{\max}(\vec{r_q}, t) = \kappa^K_{\max}(\vec{r_q}, t) = \frac{h_K}{2} \left( || \vec{u}(\vec{t,r_q}) || + c(\vec{t,r_q}) \right),
\end{equation}
%
where $\vec{r_q}$ denotes the position of a quadrature point.\\
As stated earlier, the entropy viscosity coefficients, denoted by $\kappa_e$ and $\mu_e$, are set proportional to the entropy production evaluated by computing the local entropy residual $D_e$. The definitions also include the inter-element jump of the entropy flux $J$, thus allowing for the detection of discontinuities other than shocks:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ent_visc_coeff}
\mu^K_e(\vec{r_q},t) = \kappa^K_e(\vec{r_q},t) = h_K^2 \frac{\max\left( | D^K_e(\vec{r_q},t) |, J^K[s](t) \right)}{|| s - \bar{s} ||_{\infty}} 
\end{equation}
%
where $|| \cdot ||_{\infty}$ and $\bar{\cdot}$ denote the $L_\infty$ norm and the average operator over the entire computational domain, respectively. The definition of the jump $J$ is spatial discretization-dependent and examples of definitions can be found in \cite{valentin} for DGFEM. For continuous FEM, the jump of a given quantity is defined at the inter-element change in the normal derivative. We take the largest value over all faces $f$ present on the boundary $\partial K$ of element $K$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jump_CFEM}
J^K[s](t) = \max_{f\in\partial K}  \max_{\vec{r_q} \in f} \jmp{\grad s(\vec{r_q},t) \cdot \vec{n}(\vec{r_q}) }_f
\end{equation}
%
where $\jmp{a(\vec{r_q})}_f$ denotes the inter-element jump in $a(\vec{r})$ at quadrature point $\vec{r_q}$ on face $f$.  
The denominator $|| s - \bar{s} ||_{\infty}$ is used for dimensionality purposes \tcr{and should not be of the same order as $h$, on penalty of loosing the high-order accuracy}. Currently, there are no theoretical justification for choosing the denominator. 
Finally, the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
\mu(\vec{r},t)    = \min\Big( \mu_e(\vec{r},t)   \,,\, \mu_{\max}(\vec{r},t)    \Big) 
\quad \text{ and } \quad 
\kappa(\vec{r},t) = \min\Big( \kappa_e(\vec{r},t)\,,\, \kappa_{\max}(\vec{r},t) \Big).
\end{equation}
%
These definitions \tcr{enable} the following properties: 
In shock regions, the entropy viscosity coefficient will experience a peak because of entropy production and thus will saturates to the first-order viscosity. The first-order coefficients are known to be over-dissipative and will smooth out any oscillatory behavior. Elsewhere in the domain, entropy production will be small and the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are of order $h^2$.
Using the above definitions, high-order accuracy for the entropy-based viscous stabilization method was demonstrated using several 1-D shock tube and various 2-D tests \cite{jlg1, jlg2, valentin}.

%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Issues in the Low-Mach Regime} 
%===================================================================================================

In the Low-Mach Regime, the flow is known to be isentropic, resulting in very little entropy production. Since the entropy viscosity method is directly based on the evaluation of the local entropy production, it is of interest to study how the entropy viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ scale in the low-Mach regime. In practice, the entropy residual $D_e$ will be very small and so will be the denominator $|| s - \bar{s} ||_{\infty}$, thus making the definition of the viscosity coefficients \eqt{eq:ent_visc_coeff}, undetermined and likely ill-scaled.  One possible rigorous approach would consists of expanding the numerator and denominator in terms of the Mach number and derive the limit when the Mach number goes to zero. Such derivation can be avoided by noticing that the entropy residual $D_e$ can be recast as a function of pressure, density, velocity, and speed of sound as shown in \eqt{eq:ent_res} of \sct{sec:new_ent_prod}. This alternate entropy residual definition is the basis for the low-Mach analysis carried out in this paper and possesses several advantages that are detailed in \sct{sec:new_ent_prod}.
%Therefore, the current definition of the viscosity coefficients seems unadapted to subsonic flow and could lead to ill-scaled dissipative terms. 
%A solution would be to recast the entropy residual as a function of other variables in order to have more freedom in the choice of the normalization parameter. 
%With this approach, the viscosity coefficients are still defined proportional to the entropy residual that is a good indicator of the flow type (subsonic, transonic and supersonic flow). Plus, a different normalization parameter could be chosen, based on a low Mach asymptotic study so that the viscosity coefficients are well-scaled in the low Mach asymptotic limit (see \sct{sec:extension}).
%The idea is to still define the viscosity coefficient proportional to the entropy residual since it is a good indicator of the flow type (subsonic or supersonic).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{An All-speed Reformulation of the Entropy Viscosity Method} \label{sec:extension}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, the entropy residual $D_e$ is recast as a function of the pressure, the density, the velocity and the speed of sound. Then, a low Mach asymptotic study of the multi-D Euler equations is performed in order to derive the correct normalization parameter. 

%===================================================================================================
\subsection{New Definition of the Entropy Production Residual}\label{sec:new_ent_prod} 
%===================================================================================================

The first step in defining a viscosity coefficient that behaves well in the low-Mach limit is to recast the entropy residual in terms of the thermodynamic variables, as shown in \eqt{eq:ent_res}, that will be more adequate for the derivation of the low Mach asymptotic equations:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ent_res}
D_e(\vec{r},t) = \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \grad s = \frac{s_e}{P_e} \left( \underbrace{\frac{d P}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt}}_{\tilde{D}_e(\vec{r},t)} \right),
\end{equation} 
%
where $\frac{d }{dt}$ denotes the material or total derivative ($\frac{d }{dt}:= \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \grad$), and $x_y$ is the standard shortcut notation for the partial derivative of $x$ with respect to $y$, i.e., $P_e:=\frac{\partial P}{\partial e}$. The detailed steps that lead to the new formulation of the entropy residual $D_e$ are omitted in the main body of this paper but are provided in \app{app:ent_res}. 
%
The entropy residuals $D_e$ and $\tilde{D}_e$ are proportional and will experience similar variations in space and time. Thus, we elect to employ $\tilde{D}_e$ instead of $D_e$ in the local evaluation of the entropy residual. This new expression has multiple advantages:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item an analytical expression of the entropy function $s$ is no longer needed: the residual $\tilde{D}_e$ is evaluated using the local values of pressure, density, velocity and speed of sound. Deriving an entropy function for some complex equation of states can be difficult.
\item additional normalizations suitable of the residual $\tilde{D}_e$ can be devised. Examples include the pressure itself or combinations of the density, the speed of sound and the norm of the velocity: $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ and $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$. 
\end{itemize}
%
Denoting the new normalization by $\norm_P$, the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are now defined as proportional to the new  residual $\tilde{D}_e$ on the model of \eqt{eq:ent_visc_coeff} as follows:
%
\tcr{how about the change in $J$?}
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:visc_definition}
\begin{equation}
\mu^K_e(\vec{r},t)    = h_K^2 \frac{\max\left( | \tilde{D}^K_e(\vec{r_q},t) |, J^K[P](t) \right)}{\norm_P^\mu}    \, ,
\end{equation} 
\text{and} 
\begin{equation}
\kappa^K_e(\vec{r},t) = h_K^2 \frac{\max\left( | \tilde{D}^K_e(\vec{r_q},t) |, J^K[P](t) \right)}{\norm_P^\kappa} \, .
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
Note that now the jump operates on pressure (it could equivalently operate on the quantities $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ and $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$). The normalization parameters have units of pressure, hence the use of the subscript $P$. We are not requiring the same normalization for both $\mu_e$ and $\kappa_e$ so the entropy viscosity coefficients can be different. The low-Mach asymptotic study presented next will \tcr{inform} and determine the choice of normalization.

As mentioned earlier, the normalization parameter $n_P$ must be of the same units as the pressure for the viscosity coefficients to have the unit of a kinematic viscosity $(m^2 / s)$. Multiples options are available to us: $P$, $\rho c^2$, $\rho c || \vec{u} ||$ and $\rho || \vec{u} ||^2$. The choice of the normalization parameter cannot be random if the definition of the viscosity coefficient is wanted to be well-scaled for a wide range of Mach numbers. For example, by choosing either $n_P = \rho || \vec{u} ||^2$ or $n_P = \rho c^2$, the viscosity coefficient will not scale the same as the Mach number decreases. Therefore, it is proposed to carry, in \sct{sec:lowMach}, a low-Mach asymptotic study of the multi-D Euler equations in order to determine the correct expression for the normalization parameter $n_P$.

\subsection{Low-Mach asymptotic study of the multi-D Euler equations} \label{sec:lowMach}
%===================================================================================================

The asymptotic study requires the multi-D Euler equations to be non dimensionalized: the objective is to make the Mach number appears and thus, use a polynomial expansion of the variables as a function of the Mach number in order to derive the leading, first- and second-order equations. Before detailing the steps of the asymptotic method, let us have a closer look at the system of equations under consideration. The initial system of equations is composed of the multi-D Euler equations with artificial dissipative terms that are added to each equation as explained in \sct{sec:entro_visc} for stability purpose. The resulting system of equations is alike the multi-D Navier-Stokes equations in a sense that it contains second-order derivative terms. Thus, it would be interesting to look at the steps employed in the asymptotic study of the multi-D Navier-Stokes equations in order to understand how the dissipative terms are treated. Fortunately, this process is well-documented in the literature \cite{LowMach1, LowMach2, LowMach3} for both multi-D Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations. The work presented here is mainly inspired of \cite{Muller} that focuses on the asymptotic study in the low Mach regime of Navier-Stokes equations. During the derivation, the reader has to keep in mind that the objective of this section is to derive the scaling of the normalization parameter $n_P$ involved in the definition of the viscosity coefficients given in \eqt{eq:ent_visc_coeff}, so that the dissipative terms are well-scaled for two cases: the isentropic form of the Euler equations that degenerate to the incompressible system of equations in the low Mach limit, and the non-isentropic version of the Euler equations with the formation of shocks that need stabilization to prevent spurious oscillations from forming.\\
%multi-D Euler equations degenerate to the incompressible system of equations, which implies that the dissipative terms are well-scaled. 
%The main steps of the derivation are presented in the following of this section and are done using the Ideal Gas equation of state for simplicity:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:IGEOS}
%P = ( \gamma-1) \rho e
%\end{equation}
%where $\gamma$ is the heat capacity ratio.\\
To express \eqt{eq:euler_visc} in dimensionless variables, the following dimensional variables are introduced:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:norm_param}
\rho &=& \frac{\rho^*}{\rho_{\infty}} \text{, } P = \frac{P^*}{\rho_{\infty}c^2_{\infty}} \text{, } \mu = \frac{\mu^*}{\mu_{\infty}} \text{, } \text{, }  E = \frac{E^*}{c^2_{\infty} } \text{, } 
\mu = \frac{\mu^*}{\mu_{\infty}} \text{, }\nonumber \\
 \kappa &=& \frac{\kappa^*}{\kappa_{\infty}} \text{, }
x = \frac{x^*}{L_{\infty}} \text{, } t = \frac{t^*}{L_{\infty} / u_{\infty}} \text{, } u = \frac{u^*}{u_{\infty}}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where  the subscript $\infty$ and the upper script $*$ denote the far field or stagnation quantities and the dimensionless variables, respectively. The reference quantities are chosen such that the non dimensional flow quantities are of order one for any low reference-Mach number
\begin{equation}
M_{\infty} = \frac{u_{\infty}}{c_{\infty}}
\end{equation}
where $c_{\infty}$ is a reference value for the speed of sound.
%The reference time $t_{\infty}$ will take two values: $t_{\infty} = L_{\infty} / u_{\infty}$ for fluid time scale and $t_{\infty} = M_{\infty} L_{\infty} / u_{\infty}$ for acoustic time scale. The objective is to isolate the effects of the acoustic wave in the asymptotic limit during a transient of a low Mach shock for example.
Then, using the non dimensional quantities and the multi-D Euler equations from \eqt{eq:euler_visc} , the following non dimensional form is obtained:
\begin{subequations} 
\label{eq:Euler_eq2}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler_eq2_cont}
\partial_{t^*} \rho^*+ \nabla^* \left(  \rho^* \vec{u}^*  \right) = \frac{1}{Re_{\infty} Pr_{\infty}} \nabla^* \cdot ( \kappa^* \nabla^* \rho^* )
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:euler_eq2_mom}
\partial_{t^*} \left( \rho^* \vec{u}^* \right) + \nabla^* \left( \rho^* \vec{u}^*\otimes \vec{u}^* \right) + \frac{1}{M_{\infty}^2}\nabla^* \left( P^* \right) = 
\frac{1}{Re_{\infty}}\nabla \left( \rho^* \mu^* \nabla^* \vec{u}^* \right) + \nonumber \\
\frac{1}{Re_{\infty} Pr_{\infty}} \nabla^* \cdot (\vec{u}^*\otimes \kappa^* \nabla^* \rho^* )
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:euler_eq2_energy}
\partial_{t^*} \left( \rho^* E^* \right) + \nabla^* \cdot \left[ \vec{u}^* \left( \rho^* E^* + P^* \right) \right] = \frac{1}{Re_{\infty} Pr_{\infty}} \nabla^* \cdot(\kappa^* \nabla(\rho^* e^*)) + \nonumber \\
\frac{\tilde{M_{\infty}}^2}{Re_{\infty}}\nabla^* \cdot \left( \vec{u}^* \rho^* \mu^* \nabla^* \vec{u}^* \right)
+ \frac{M_{\infty}^2}{2 Re_{\infty} Pr_{\infty}} \nabla^* \cdot (\kappa^* u^{*,2} \nabla^* \rho^*)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler_eq2_eos}
P = \left( \gamma-1 \right) \left( \rho E + M_{\infty}^2 \rho u^2 \right)
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where the \emph{numerical} Reynolds $(Re_{\infty})$ and Prandtl $(Pr_{\infty})$ numbers are defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ref_numb}
Re_{\infty} = \frac{u_{\infty} L_{\infty}}{\mu_{\infty}} \text{ and }
Pr_{\infty} = \frac{\mu_{\infty}}{\kappa_{\infty}} \text{.}
\end{eqnarray}
The Reynolds and Prandtl \emph{numerical numbers} are related to the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ through the viscosity reference values. The objective is to derive the asymptotic equations and see how the artificial dissipative terms affect the physics. For simplicity purpose, the upper script $^*$ is dropped in the remaining of this section. It is, then, chosen to distinguish two cases that were mentioned earlier in this section: the non-isentropic and isentropic Euler equations.
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-isentropic Euler equations:\\
Under this assumptions, shocks can form even with low Mach numbers (for instance, a step initial condition will trigger all of the waves independently of the Mach number). The non-dimensional form of the Euler equations given in \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2} provides some insight on the dominant terms in the low Mach limit. This is particular obvious in the momentum equation \eqt{eq:euler_eq2_mom} with the pressure gradient that is weighted by the inverse of the Mach number square. Thus, in the presence of shock (non-isentropic Euler equations), this pressure gradient term in the momentum equation will need to be stabilized by some dissipative terms of the same scaling, to prevent spurious oscillation from forming. This statement gives us a condition to determine the scaling of the non-dimensionalized numbers $Re_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty}$ and leaves us with three options: $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = 1$ ($\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 2, -2 \right\}$) or $Re_{\infty} = 1$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ ($\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 0, 2 \right\}$) or $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ ($\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 2, 0 \right\}$). Arguments related to the validity of the three previous options will be given later in this section.
\item The isentropic Euler equations and the incompressible limit:\\
In this particular case, shock cannot form and the compressible Euler equations are known to converge to the incompressible fluid equations when the Mach number tends to zero. When adding dissipative terms, as required in the entropy viscosity method, the low Mach asymptotic limit has to be conserved: the pressure fluctuations are of the order of the Mach number square, and the velocity vector obeys to the divergent constraint $\div \vec{u}_0 = 0$. Such conditions are used to devise a scaling of the non-dimensionalized numbers, $Re_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty}$, for the case under consideration. Once again, by studying the momentum equation, it is observed that the leading, $P_0$, and first-order, $P_1$, terms of the pressure are spatially constant if only if $Re_{\infty} = Pr_{\infty} = 1$:  
%Consequently, the physical solution is smooth, the equation of state is of the form $\rho = f(P)$ and the speed of sound can be expressed as follows: 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:sound_speed_iso}
%c^2 = \left. \frac{\partial P}{ \partial \rho}\right)_s = \frac{dP}{d\rho} = \frac{d (f^{-1})}{d \rho} 
%\end{equation}
%where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of the function $f(P)$. Using the equation of state $\rho = f(P)$ and \eqt{eq:sound_speed_iso}, the entropy residual given in \eqt{eq:ent_res} is shown to be zero (\app{app:ise_equ}). Thus, the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are also zero, independently of the choice of the normalization $n_P$, since defined proportional to the entropy residual (\eqt{eq:visc_definition}). 
%This result is crucial for the low Mach asymptotic limit since it implies that the dissipative terms in the right hand-side of \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2} vanish in the case of an isentropic flow. Thus, the dissipative terms are not ill-scaled and the compressible Euler equations should degenerate to the incompressible system of equations in the low Mach asymptotic limit.
\end{itemize}
Even if it is now known that the dissipative terms will not affect the low Mach asymptotic limit of the Euler equations, the asymptotic equations are still derived with the objective of determining which of the three options enumerated in the non-isentropic Euler equations will fit better our purpose. In other term, we want to determine if there is any valid arguments that will favor one of the above three options: for example in the momentum equation (\eqt{eq:euler_eq2_mom}), is it better to dissipate on the velocity in the low Mach limit by setting $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Pr_{\infty} Re_{\infty} = 1$, or to set $Re_{\infty} = 1$ and $Pr_{\infty} Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and dissipate on the density instead? To do so, each variable is expanded in term of the Mach number (example given in \eqt{eq:expansion} for the pressure $P$) in order to derive the leading, first- and second-order equations. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expansion}
P(\vec{r}, t) = P_0(\vec{r}, t) + P_1(\vec{r}, t) M_{\infty} + P_2(\vec{r}, t) M_{\infty}^2 + \dots \text{ with } M_{\infty} \to 0
\end{equation}
It is chosen to first study the case with $Re_{\infty} = 1$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ which yields the following non-dimensionalized system of equations:
\begin{subequations} 
\label{eq:Euler_eq3}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler_eq3_cont}
\partial_{t^*} \rho^*+ \nabla^* \left(  \rho^* \vec{u}^*  \right) = \nabla^* \cdot ( \kappa^* \nabla^* \rho^* )
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:euler_eq3_mom}
\partial_{t^*} \left( \rho^* \vec{u}^* \right) + \nabla^* \left( \rho^* \vec{u}^*\otimes \vec{u}^* \right) + \frac{1}{M_{\infty}^2}\nabla^* \left( P^* \right) = 
\frac{1}{M_{\infty}^2}\nabla \left( \rho^* \mu^* \nabla^* \vec{u}^* \right) + \nonumber \\
 \nabla^* \cdot (\vec{u}^*\otimes \kappa^* \nabla^* \rho^* )
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:euler_eq3_energy}
\partial_{t^*} \left( \rho^* E^* \right) + \nabla^* \cdot \left[ \vec{u}^* \left( \rho^* E^* + P^* \right) \right] = \nabla^* \cdot(\kappa^* \nabla(\rho^* e^*)) + \nonumber \\
\nabla^* \cdot \left( \vec{u}^* \rho^* \mu^* \nabla^* \vec{u}^* \right)
+ M_{\infty}^2\nabla^* \cdot (\kappa^* u^{*,2} \nabla^* \rho^*)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler_eq3_eos}
P = \left( \gamma-1 \right) \left( \rho E + M_{\infty}^2 \rho u^2 \right)
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Then, the asymptotic equations are derived using \eqt{eq:expansion}. The momentum equation given in \eqt{eq:euler_eq3_mom} is investigated first, in order to study the pressure waves that are known to be of the order of the Mach number square in the asymptotic limit:
 \begin{subequations}\label{eq:asympt_equ1}
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ1_cont}
&&\text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-2}$:} \nonumber\\
&& \grad P_0 = \div \left( \vec{u} \kappa \grad \rho \right)_0
 \end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ1_mom}
&& \text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-1}$:} \nonumber\\
&&\grad P_1 = \div \left( \vec{u} \kappa \grad \rho \right)_1
  \end{eqnarray}
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ1_ener}
\text{At order $1$:} \nonumber\\
\partial_t (\rho_0 \vec{u}_0) + \div ( \rho_0 \vec{u}_0 \otimes \vec{u}_0)+\grad P_2 = \div (\rho \mu \grad^s \vec{u})_1 +\div ( \kappa \vec{u} \grad \rho)_2
 \end{eqnarray}
 \end{subequations}
We now focus our study on \eqt{eq:asympt_equ1_cont} and \eqt{eq:asympt_equ1_mom} that are usually used to show that the pressure is constant up to fluctuations of order Mach number square. The dissipation in \eqt{eq:asympt_equ1_cont} and \eqt{eq:asympt_equ1_mom} is done on the gradient of the density. Assuming an isentropic flow and using the simplified equation of state $\rho =f(P)$, the dissipative terms can be recast as a function of the pressure as follows:
 \begin{subequations}\label{eq:asympt_equ2}
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ2_cont}
&&\text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-2}$:} \nonumber\\
&& \grad P_0 = \div \left( \vec{u} \kappa \frac{df(P)}{d\rho} \grad P \right)_0 = \div \left( \vec{u} \kappa c^{-2} \grad P \right)_0
 \end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ2_mom}
&& \text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-1}$:} \nonumber\\
&&\grad P_1 = \div \left( \vec{u} \kappa \frac{df(P)}{d\rho} \grad P \right)_1 = \div \left( \vec{u} \kappa c^{-2} \grad P \right)_1
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
It is then noted, that a possible solution of the system given in \eqt{eq:asympt_equ2} (assuming that $\kappa\neq 0$) is $\grad P_0 = \grad P_1 = 0$ which implies that the pressure fluctuations are of the form $P(t \vec{r}) = P_0(t) + M_{\infty}P_2(t, \vec{r}) $ as required in the low Mach asymptotic limit, where $P_1$ subsumed in $P_0$. Even if the low Mach asymptotic convergence of \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2} to the incompressible system of equations is ensured by the definition of the viscosity coefficients proportional to the entropy production, it seems more consistent to dissipate only on the density (or the pressure) in the  low Mach limit.\\
The same analysis can be carried for the case $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = 1$. Under this assumption, the leading and first-order asymptotic equations of the momentum equations are the following:
 \begin{subequations}\label{eq:asympt_equ3}
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ3_cont}
&&\text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-2}$:} \nonumber\\
&& \grad P_0 = \div \left( \rho \mu \grad^s \vec{u} \right)_0
 \end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ3_mom}
&& \text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-1}$:} \nonumber\\
&&\grad P_1 = \div \left( \rho \mu \grad^s \vec{u} \right)_1
  \end{eqnarray}
 \end{subequations}
In this particular case, the dissipation occurs on the velocity. The above system is easily analyzed in $1$D where the velocity is known to obey the steady-state divergent constraint
$\div \vec{u}_0 = \grad^s \vec{u}_0 = \partial_x u_0 = 0$ which implies $u(t,x) = u_0(t) + M_{\infty} u_1(t,x)$. From \eqt{eq:asympt_equ3_cont}, the solution $\partial_x P_0 = 0$ is obtained. On the other hand, since $u_1$ is both a function of time and space, the first-order pressure term $P_1$ cannot be spatially constant and will induce pressure fluctuation of the order of the Mach number (assuming $\mu \neq 0$). Thus, the options requesting $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ are not valid, which leaves us with the first option: $Re_{\infty} = 1$ and $Pr_{\infty} Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$. \\
Knowing the scaling of the non-dimensionalized numbers $Re_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty}$, the normalization parameters $n_P$ of the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ can be determined. Only the steps leading to the derivation of $n_P^{\mu}$ for the viscosity coefficient $\mu$ are detailed. Using the definition of the viscosity coefficient in \eqt{eq:visc_definition} and the scaling of \eqt{eq:norm_param}, it can be shown that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:norm_relation}
\mu_{\infty} = \frac{ \rho_{\infty} c_{\infty}^2 u_{\infty} L }{ n_{P,\infty}^{\mu} } 
\end{equation}
where $n_{P,\infty}$ is the far-field quantity for the normalization parameter $n_P$. Substituing \eqt{eq:norm_relation} into \eqt{eq:ref_numb} and remembering that the numerical Reynolds number scales as one by assumption, it yields:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:norm_relation_bis}
n_{P,\infty}^{\mu} = \rho_{\infty} c_{\infty}^2
\end{equation}
\eqt{eq:norm_relation_bis} tells us that in the asymptotic limit, the normalization parameter $n_P$ scales as $\rho_{\infty} c_{\infty}^2$ which leaves us with two options:
either $n_P = \rho c^2$ or $n_P = P$. The choice was made to use $n_P^{\mu} = \rho c^2$ in the low Mach asymptotic limit: it was found to behave well and the pressure can become locally negative and null in some particular case as shown in \sct{sec:results}. \\
On the same model, the normalization parameter $n_P^{\kappa}$ for the viscosity coefficient $\kappa$ is derived. Remembering that the Prandtl number scales as the Mach number squares, it is shown that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:norm_relation_ter}
n_{P,\infty}^{\kappa} = \rho_{\infty} u_{\infty}^2
\end{equation}
which implies $n_{P}^{\kappa} = \rho ||\vec{u} ||^2$.\\
%Once the dimensionless equations are obtained, the next step consists of 
%From \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2}, it is observed that the scaling of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers will affect the asymptotic equations because of the dissipative terms. By studying the effect of the dissipative terms onto the asymptotic equations, the scaling of the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ can be determined so that the pressure and velocity fluctuations remain of the order of the Mach number square and the Mach number, respectively. For the purpose of this section it is assumed that the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers scale as the Mach number to the power $n$ and $m$, respectively: $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^n$ and $Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^m$ with $\left\{ n,m \right\} \in$ positive or negative integers. Different values for the pair $\left\{ n,m \right\}$ are investigated for the isentropic and non-isentropic cases. It is also noted that having $n=m$ is equivalent to setting the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ equal. The objective of this investigation is to make a choice on the scaling of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, obtain the corresponding asymptotic equations, and determine whether or not the low Mach asymptotic limit is preserved. Since the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers are function of the viscosity coefficients and thus, of the normalization parameter $n(P)$ defined in \eqt{eq:norm_param}, a scaling for the function $n(P)$ will be derived as well. For generality purpose, two distinct cases are investigated: the isentropic low Mach limit and the anisentropic low Mach limit where shock can form. \\
%
%We first investigate the case of the isentropic Euler equations in the low Mach limit.  Thus, the dissipative terms will have no influence on the \\
%Under this assumption, shocks may occurs even for small Mach numbers (for instance, a step initial condition will trigger all of the waves independently of the Mach number), and the scaling of the terms must be studied. In the momentum equation, \eqt{eq:euler_eq2_mom}, the pressure gradient will dominate the other terms because of the $1 / M^2$ and will have to be stabilized in the shock region to prevent spurious oscillations to form. Thus, the dissipative terms of the right hand-side of \eqt{eq:euler_eq2_mom} will have to scale the same as the pressure term, which leaves us with three options that can be expressed with the pair $\left\{ n,m \right\}$ as follows: $\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 2, -2 \right\}$ ($Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = 1$) or $\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 0, 2 \right\}$ ($Re_{\infty} = 1$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$) or $\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 2, 0 \right\}$ ($Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$). By looking at the momentum equation (\eqt{eq:euler_eq2_mom}) to determine the scaling of the dissipative terms, the continuity and energy equations may be affected in an undesirable way, specially when studying the convergence of the compressible Euler equations to the isentropic and incompressible version of the Euler equations. Thus, a low Mach asymptotic study of the Euler equation when assuming an isentropic flow can help us determine the suitable pair $\left\{ n,m \right\}$. \\
%It is now assumed an isentropic flow in order to perform a low Mach asymptotic study. We first study the case where $\left\{ n,m \right\}$ = $\left\{ 2, 0 \right\}$ ($Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty}Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^2$) which implies the following Euler equations:
%
%Using the assumption $m=n=0$ for the fluid time scale, the system of equation given in \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2} becomes:
%The next step consists of deriving the asymptotic equations:
%The following asymptotic equations are obtained:
%Before deriving the leading-order equation, a choice needs to be made on how the numerical Reynolds number scales. Multiple options are available to us and a few example are given: $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}$, or $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^{-1}$ or $Re_{\infty} = 1$. Let us assume for academy purpose that the numerical Reynolds number scales as the inverse of the Mach number square:  $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}^{-2}$. The best way to evaluate the impact of this choice on the equations, is to look at the momentum equation and try to derive the order $M_{\infty}^{-2}$:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:mom_leading_wrong}
%\grad P_0 = \div (\rho_0 \mu_0 \grad \vec{u}_0 + \vec{u}_0 \otimes \grad \rho_0 )
%\end{equation}
%which is known to be (\cite{LowMach3})
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:mom_leading_right}
%\grad P_0 = 0 
%\end{equation}
%It is clear that \eqt{eq:mom_leading_wrong} and \eqt{eq:mom_leading_right} will not yield the same result. The same conclusion is drawn when deriving the order $M_{\infty}^{-1}$ of the momentum equation, making our initial assumption not suitable. From the above result, it is understood that the numerical Reynolds number has to scale as one so that it does not affect the orders $M_{\infty}^{-2}$ and $M_{\infty}^{-1}$ of the momentum equations: $Re_{\infty} = 1$. Thus, with such assumption, \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2} implies:
%From the first two asymptotic equations, it is concluded that the leading- and first-order pressure are constant in space. Thus, the pressure fluctuation will be of order to the Mach number square: $P(\vec{x},t) = P_0(t) + M_{\infty}^2 \cdot P_2(\vec{x},t)$ where $P_1$ subsumed in $P_0$. It remains to investigate how the velocity fluctuations scale as a function of the Mach number. Using the Ideal gas equation of state to relate the leading-order pressure to the total and internal energy $P_0 = (\gamma-1) \rho_0 e_0 = (\gamma-1) \rho_0 E_0$, the first-order energy equation can be recast as follows: 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy_fo}
% (\gamma-1) \partial_tP_0 + \gamma \div \left( \vec{u}_0 P_0\right) = (\gamma-1)\div(\kappa_0 \grad P_0)
%\end{equation}
%Remembering that $\grad P_0 = 0$,  \eqt{eq:energy_fo} becomes:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:divu0}
%-\frac{1}{\gamma P_0}\frac{dP_0}{dt} = \div \vec{u}_0
%\end{equation}
%that degenerates into the classical divergent constraint for incompressible flow, $\div \vec{u}_0 = 0$, when assuming a constant background pressure $P_0$ or at steady-state. Thus, at steady-state, the velocity fluctuations will be of the order of the Mach number. \\
%The above results show that the choice $Re_{\infty} = Pr_{\infty} = 1$ conserves the low Mach asymptotic limit when using the fluid time scale. Thus, it remains to determine the scaling of the normalization parameter $n(P)$. In the case under consideration, the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are set equal. Using the definition of the viscosity coefficient in \eqt{eq:visc_definition} and the scaling of \eqt{eq:norm_param}, it can be shown that:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:norm_relation}
%\mu_{\infty} = \frac{ \rho_{\infty} c_{\infty}^2 u_{\infty} L }{ n_{P,\infty} } 
%\end{equation}
%where $n_{P,\infty}$ is the far-field quantity for the normalization parameter $n_P$. Substituing \eqt{eq:norm_relation} into \eqt{eq:ref_numb} and remembering that the numerical Reynolds number scales as one by assumption, it yields:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:norm_relation_bis}
%n_{P,\infty} = \rho_{\infty} c_{\infty}^2
%\end{equation}
%\eqt{eq:norm_relation_bis} tells us that in the asymptotic limit, the normalization parameter $n_P$ scales as $\rho_{\infty} c_{\infty}^2$ which leaves us with two options:
%either $n_P = \rho c^2$ or $n_P = P$. The choice was made to use $n_P = \rho c^2$ in the low Mach asymptotic limit: it was found to behave well and the pressure can become locally negative and null in some particular case as shown in \sct{sec:results}.\\
%The above derivation of the asymptotic equations does not account for the acoustic waves that can strongly influence the solution when dealing with low Mach shock. It is then proposed to redo the asymptotic derivation but by considering the acoustic time scale instead of the fluid one. \\
%
%Acoustic time scale: $Str_{\infty} = 1 / M_{\infty}$ and $Re_{\infty} = Pr_{\infty} = M_{\infty}$ or $\left\{m, n\right\} = \left\{1, 0 \right\}$:\\
%
%The reasoning leading to the derivation of the asymptotic equations is similar to the previous case. Thus, only the mains step are given. The asymptotic equations obtained with the condition $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty} = 1$ and $t_{\infty} = M_{\infty} L_{\infty} / u_{\infty}$ are the following:
% \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:asympt_equ2}
% \text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-2}$:} && \nonumber\\
% \grad P_0 &=& 0  \nonumber\\
% \text{At order $M_{\infty}^{-1}$:} && \nonumber\\
%% \partial_t \rho_0 &=& \div ( \kappa \grad \rho )_0 \nonumber \\
% \partial_t (\rho \vec{u})_0 + \grad P_1 &=& \div (\mu_0 \rho_0 \grad^s \vec{u}_0 + \kappa_0 \vec{u}_0 \grad \rho_0 ) \nonumber \\
%% \partial_t \left( \rho E \right)_0 &=& \div(\kappa \grad(\rho e))_0 \nonumber \\
% \text{At order $1$:} && \nonumber\\
% \partial_t \rho_1 &+& \div ( \rho_0 \vec{u}_0 ) = \div ( \kappa \grad \rho )_1 \nonumber \\
% \partial_t (\rho \vec{u})_1 &+& \div ( \rho_0 \vec{u}_0 \otimes \vec{u}_0) + \grad P_2 = \div (\rho \mu \grad^s \vec{u} +\kappa \vec{u} \otimes \grad \rho )_1 \nonumber \\
% \partial_t(\rho E)_1 &+& \div \left[ \vec{u}_0 (\rho_0 E_0 + P_0) \right] = \div(\kappa \grad(\rho e))_1 \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}
%Unlike the previous case, only the leading-order pressure $P_0$ is spatially constant. Thus, the pressure fluctuations are of the order of the Mach number instead of the Mach number square as obtained for the fluid time scale: $P(\vec{x},t) = P_0(t) + M_{\infty} P_1(\vec{x},t)  + M_{\infty}^2 P_2(\vec{x},t)$. Using the equation of state, the order $1$ of the energy equation can be recast as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%(\gamma-1) \partial_t P_1 + \gamma P_0 \div \vec{u}_0 = \div(\kappa \grad(\rho e))_1
%\end{equation}
%Thus, at steady-state, in the presence of pressure fluctuation in the first-order pressure $P_1$, the right hand-side is not null and, thus, the divergence constraint from the asymptotic analysis $\div \vec{u}_0=0$ is not satisfied. By choosing the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers equal to the Mach number and one, respectively, the multi-D Euler equations do not converge to the incompressible equations in the low Mach asymptotic limit. However, it seems to be a valid choice to stabilize the acoustic waves during a transient as shown in the equation obtained for the order $M_{\infty}^{-1}$. The scaling of the normalization parameters that matches the condition $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty} = 1$ is derived on the same model as before:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:norm_relation_bis2}
%n_{P,\infty} = \rho_{\infty} u_{\infty} c_{\infty} 
%\end{equation}
%which imposes $n(P) = \rho c || \vec{u} ||$.\\
%\item $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty} = 1$ or $m=1$ and $n=0$:\\
%For this particular case, the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are not set equal. Therefore, two normalization parameters have to be determined. The details of the derivation are given in appendix (not done yet). The correct low Mach asymptotic limit was recovered with the choice $Re_{\infty} = M_{\infty}$ and $Pr_{\infty} = 1$.
For clarity purpose, the definition of the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are now recalled:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:final_def_visc_coeff}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\mu(\vec{r},t) = \max (\mu_{max}(\vec{r},t), \mu_e (\vec{r},t)) \\
\kappa(\vec{r},t) = \max (\mu_{max}(\vec{r},t), \kappa_e (\vec{r},t)) \\
\text{where } \mu_{max}(\vec{r},t) = \frac{h}{2} (||\vec{u}|| + c) \\
\mu_{e} = h^2 \frac{\max(\tilde{D_e}, J)}{\rho c^2} \\
\kappa_{e} = h^2 \frac{\max(\tilde{D_e}, J)}{\rho || \vec{u} ||^2} \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
These viscosity coefficients are valid for both the multi-D Euler equations with variable and constant area and are employed with the dissipative terms detailed in \eqt{eq:Euler_eq3}. The reader will notice that, through the derivation, none assumption was made on the type of equation of state besides the convexity condition on the entropy function $s$. The remaining of this paper (\sct{sec:results}) will focus on demonstrating that the definition of the viscosity coefficient given in \eqt{eq:final_def_visc_coeff} is indeed well-scaled in the asymptotic limit and that shocks are still well resolved. 
\begin{remark}
By choosing $Pr_{\infty}  = M_{\infty}^2$ and $Re_{\infty} = 1$, the dissipative terms in \eqt{eq:Euler_eq2} have the same scaling as the discretized dissipative terms derived from the preconditioned Roe scheme proposed by Guillard et al. in \cite{LowMach1}, to ensure the correct low Mach asymptotic limit.

\section{The dissipative-terms for the multi-D Euler equations with variable area} \label{sec:var_area_diss_terms}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\tcr{since this is NEW, I think we should make a small section after the asymptotics and before the results t make it stand out as being new work and not already included in previous work}
One of the focus of this paper is to investigate the application of the entropy viscosity method to the multi-D Euler equations with variable area. The variable area version of the Euler equations is mostly used in $1$-D and $2$-D for obvious reasons, and differs from \eqt{eq:euler_eq} by the momentum equation as shown in \eqt{eq:euler_variable_A}, that contains a non-conservative term proportional to the area gradient. For the purpose of this paper, the variable area is assumed to be a smooth function and only spatial dependent. An example can be found in \cite{SEM} where a fluid flows through a $1$-D convergent-divergent nozzle and reaches a steady-state solution.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euler_variable_A}
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{lll}
\partial_t \left( \rho A \right) + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) = 0 \\
\partial_t \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) + \div \left[A\left( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u} + P \mathbf{I} \right) \right] = P \grad A \\
\partial_t \left( \rho E \right) + \div \left[ \vec{u} \left( \rho E + P \right) \right] = 0
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
The application of the entropy viscosity method to the above system of equations is expected to be straightforward since it degenerates to the \eqt{eq:euler_eq} when assuming a constant area. Details of the derivations of the dissipative terms are available to the reader in \app{app:diss_terms} and are very similar to what was done in \cite{jlg}. An entropy residual is derived without the dissipative terms. Then, the same entropy residual is re-derived after adding dissipative terms to each equation of the system given in \eqt{eq:euler_variable_A}, and the entropy minimum principle is used as a condition to obtain a definition for each of the dissipative terms. The final result including the dissipative terms is given in \eqt{eq:euler_variable_A_bis}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euler_variable_A_bis}
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{lll}
\partial_t \left( \rho A \right) + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) = \div \left( A \kappa \grad \rho \right) \\
\partial_t \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) + \div \left[A\left( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u} + P \mathbf{I} \right) \right] = P \grad A + \div \left[ A \left( \mu \rho \grad^s \vec{u}  + \kappa \vec{u} \otimes \grad \rho \right) \right]\\
\partial_t \left( \rho E \right) + \div \left[ \vec{u} \left( \rho E + P \right) \right] = \div \left[ A \left( \kappa \grad \left( \rho e \right) + \frac{1}{2}|| \vec{u} ||^2 \kappa \grad \rho +  \rho \mu \vec{u} \grad \vec{u}  \right) \right]
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
The dissipative terms are very similar to the ones obtained for the multi-D Euler equations: each dissipative flux is multiplied by the variable area $A$ in order to  ensure conservation of the dissipative flux. When assuming a constant area, \eqt{eq:euler_visc} is retrieved. The derivation requires the viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ to be positive. The viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ will follow the definition given in \eqt{eq:final_def_visc_coeff}.

\section{Solution Techniques Spatial and Temporal Discretizations} \label{sec:solution_tech}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to detail the partial and temporal discretization used for this study, the system of equations \eqt{eq:euler_variable_A_bis} is considered under the following form for simplicity:
%\tcr{no $\div D(U) \grad U$ term here to represent the viscous regularization?}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:form}
\partial_t U + \div F\left( U \right) = S + \div D(U) \grad U
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the vector solution, $F$ is a conservative vector flux and $S$ is a vector source that can contain the non-conservative term $P\grad A$. The term $\div D(U) \grad U$ represents the artificial dissipative terms with a positive solution dependent artificial viscosity coefficient $D(U) = \mu(\vec{r},t)$. 
%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Spatial and Temporal Discretizations} \label{sec:disc}
%===================================================================================================
The system of equation given in \eqt{eq:form} is discretized using a continuous Galerkin finite element method and high-order temporal integrators provided by the MOOSE framework.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{CFEM} 
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to apply the continuous finite element method, \eqt{eq:form} is multiplied by a smooth test function $\phi$, integrated by parts and each integral is split onto each finite element $e$ of the discrete mesh $\Omega$ bounded by $\partial \Omega$, to obtain a weak solution:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:cfem}
\sum_e \int_{e} \partial_t U \phi - \sum_e \int_{e} F(U) \cdot \grad \phi + \int_{\partial \Omega} F(U) \cdot \vec{n} \phi - \sum_e \int_{e} S \phi \nonumber \\
+ \sum_e \int_{e} D(U) \grad U \cdot \grad \phi - \int_{\partial \Omega} D(U) \grad U \cdot \vec{n} \phi= 0
\end{eqnarray}
The integrals over the elements $e$ are evaluated using quadrature-point rules. The Moose framework provides a wide range of test function and quadrature rules: trapezoidal and Gauss rules among others. Linear Lagrange polynomials will be used as test functions and should ensure second-order convergence for smooth functions. The order of convergence will be demonstrated.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Temporal integrator} 
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MOOSE framework offers both first- and second-order explicit and implicit temporal integrators. In all of the numerical examples presented in \sct{sec:results}, the time-dependent term $\int_{e} \partial_t U \phi$ will be evaluated using the second-order temporal integrator BDF2. By considering three solutions, $U^{n-1}$, $U^n$ and $U^{n+1}$ at three different times $t^{n-1}$, $t^n$ and $t^{n+1}$, respectively, it yields:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:BDF2}
\int_{e} \partial_t U \phi &=& \int_{e} \left( \omega_0 U^{n+1}  + \omega_1 U^n + \omega_2 U^{n-1} \right) \phi\\
\text{with }\omega_0 &=&\frac{2\Delta t^{n+1}+\Delta t^n}{\Delta t^{n+1} \left( \Delta t^{n+1}+\Delta t^n \right)} \text{, } \nonumber \\
\omega_1 &=& -\frac{\Delta t^{n+1}+\Delta t^n}{\Delta t^{n+1} \Delta t^n}\nonumber \\
\text{ and } \omega_2 &=& \frac{\Delta t^{n+1}}{\Delta t^n \left( \Delta t^{n+1} + \Delta t^n \right)} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta t^{n} = t^n-t^{n-1}$ and $\Delta t^{n+1} = t^{n+1}-t^{n}$.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Boundary conditions} \label{sec:bc}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The boundary conditions will be treated by either using Dirichlet or Neumann conditions. The multi-D Euler equations are wave-dominated systems that require great care when dealing with boundary conditions. It is often recommended to use the characteristic equations to compute the correct flux at the boundaries. Our implementation of the subsonic boundary conditions will follow the method described in \cite{SEM} that was developed for Ideal Gas and Stiffened Gas equation of states. For each numerical solution presented in \sct{sec:results}, the type of boundary conditions used will be specified and taken amping the followings: supersonic inlet, subsonic inlet (stagnation pressure boundary), supersonic outlet and subsonic inlet (static pressure boundary). \\
The artificial diffusion coefficient $D(U)$ is set to zero at the boundary of the computational domain so that the boundary term $\int_{\partial \Omega} D(U) \grad U \cdot \vec{n} \phi$ coming from the integration per part of the artificial dissipative terms in \eqt{eq:cfem}, is unconditionally zero.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Solver} \label{sec:solver}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Jacobian-Free-Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method is used to solve for the solution at each time step. The jacobian matrix of the discretized equations was derived by hand, hard coded and used as a preconditioner. This method requires the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to the conservative variables to be known (this step is easily done for the Stiffened and Ideal Gas equation of states). The contribution of the artificial dissipative terms to the jacobian matrix is simplified by assuming constant viscosity coefficients as shown in \eqt{eq:jac_diss_term} for the dissipative terms of the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jac_diss_term}
\frac{\partial}{\partial U_i} \left( \kappa \grad \rho \grad \phi \right) = \kappa \frac{\partial}{\partial U_i} \left( \rho \right) \grad \phi
\end{equation}  
where $U_i$ denotes the set of conservative variables.

\section{Numerical Results} \label{sec:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section is dedicated to presenting $1$- and $2$-D numerical results obtained by solving \eqt{eq:euler_variable_A_bis} with the entropy viscosity method. This section has two objectives: validate our new definition of the viscosity coefficients for the low Mach limit, and, make sure that the new definition can still resolve shocks.\\
The first set of $1$-D simulations consist of liquid water and steam flowing in a convergent-divergent nozzle. This test is interesting for multiple reasons: a steady-state is reached (some stabilization methods are known to have difficulties to reach a steady-state (\cite{FluxLimiter, FluxLimiter2}), it can be performed for liquid and gas phases, and, an analytical solution of the steady-state solution is available which allow for convergence study. The $1$-D Leblanc shock tube test \cite{Leblanc} (in a straight pipe) is also performed and consists of a flow developing shocks. A convergence study will be performed in order to demonstrate convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution. A slow moving shock is also investigated \cite{james}. This test is interesting to evaluate the capabilities of the method at damping the post-shock low frequency noise. \\ 
This section also included $2$-D simulations from subsonic to supersonic flows. Subsonic flows of a gas over a $2$-D cylinder and a hump \cite{Hump} are simulated and results are shown for various far-field Mach numbers. Numerical results of a supersonic flow in a compression corner are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the new definition in the supersonic case. Convergence studies are performed when an analytical solution is available. \\
For each simulation, informations relative to the boundary conditions and the equation of state will be provided. All of the numerical solution presented in this section are run with the second-order temporal integrator $BDF2$ and linear polynomials test functions. The integrals are numerically computed using a second-order Gauss quadrature rule. The Ideal Gas \cite{IGEOS} or Stiffened Gas equation of state \cite{SGEOS} are used and a generic formulation is recalled in \eqt{eq:eos}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eos}
P = (\gamma-1) \rho (e-q) - \gamma P_{\infty}
\end{equation}
where the parameters $q$ and $P_{\infty}$ are fluid dependent and will be specified in time. \eqt{eq:eos} degenerates to the Ideal Gas equation of state by setting $q$ and $P_{\infty}$ to zero. The Ideal and Stiffened Gas equation of states have a convex entropy $s$:
\begin{equation}
s = C_v \ln \left( \frac{P+P_{\infty}}{\rho^{\gamma-1}} \right) \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $C_v$ is the heat capacity at constant volume.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Liquid water in a $1$-D divergent-convergent nozzle} \label{sec:liquid_nozzle}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simulation consists of liquid water flowing through a $1$-D convergent-divergent nozzle with the following equation, $A(x) = 1 + 0.5 \cos(2 \pi x / L)$, where $L=1m$ is the length of the nozzle. At the inlet,  the stagnation pressure and temperature are set to $P_0 = 1 MPa$ and $T_0 = 453 K$, respectively. At the outlet, only the static pressure is specified: $P_s = 0.5MPa$. Details about the theory related to the inlet and outlet boundary conditions can be found in \cite{SEM}. Initially, the temperature is uniform and set equal to the stagnation temperature and the pressure linearly decreases from the stagnation pressure to the static one. Finally, the liquid is assumed at rest. The Stiffened Gas equation of state is used to model the liquid water with the parameters provided in \tbl{tbl:stff_gas_eos_liq}.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
 \caption{\label{tbl:stff_gas_eos_liq} Stiffened Gas Equation of State parameters for liquid water.}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
 \hline
$\gamma$ & $C_v$ $(J\cdot kg^{-1} \cdot K^{-1})$ & $P_{\infty}$ $(Pa)$ & $q$ $(J \cdot kg^{-1})$ \\
 \hline
2.35 & 1816 & $10^9$ & $-1167.10^3$   \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
Because of the low pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet, the smooth initial conditions, and the large value of $P_{\infty}$, the flow remains subsonic and thus, should not display any shock. Enthalpy and entropy are conserved through the nozzle, and these conservation relations are used to determine the exact solution at steady-state \cite{nozzle_exact}.
Plots of the Mach number, density and pressure are given at steady-state in \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_liq_vel}, \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_liq_density}, \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_liq_press}, respectively, along with the exact solution for comparison. The viscosity coefficients are also plotted in \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_liq_visc}. The mesh used is uniform and has $50$ cells.
%Since a steady-state analytical solution is available to us (REF), a convergence study is performed in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the entropy viscosity method by computing the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error between the numerical and exact solutions.

\end{figure}
In \fig{fig:1d_liq_nozzle}, the numerical solutions of the pressure, velocity and density obtained with the first-order viscosity (FOV) and the entropy viscosity method (EVM) are plotted against the exact solution. A fairly coarse mesh ($50$ cells) was used. The numerical solution obtained with the EVM and the exact solution perfectly overlap.
On the other hand, the numerical solution run with the FOV does not give the correct steady-state: this is an illustration of the effect of ill-scaled dissipative terms. 
It is also noted that the second-order viscosity coefficient  is very small compare to the first-order one as expected (\fig{fig:1d_nozzle_liq_visc}): (i) the numerical solution is smooth as shown in \fig{fig:1d_liq_nozzle} and (ii) the flow is in a low Mach regime and thus isentropic . A convergence study was performed using the exact solution as a reference: the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error and the corresponding convergence rates are computed at steady-state on various uniform mesh from $4$ to $256$ cells. The results for linear polynomials $\mathbb{Q}_1$ are reported in \tbl{tbl:l1_norm_liq} and \tbl{tbl:l2_norm_liq} for the primitive variables: density, velocity and pressure.

It is observed that the convergence rate for the L$1$ and L$2$ norm of the error is $2$: the entropy viscosity method conserves the high-order accuracy when the numerical solution is smooth, and the new definition of the entropy viscosity coefficient seems to behave as expected in the low Mach limit.

Instead of liquid water, we now simulate a flow of steam using the exact same $1$-D geometry, initial conditions and boundary conditions as in \sct{sec:liquid_nozzle}. The Stiffened gas equation of state is still used but with different parameters that are given in \tbl{tbl:stff_gas_eos_vap}: steam is a gas and compressible effects will become dominant.

The pressure difference applied between the inlet and outlet is large enough to make the steam accelerates through the nozzle and result in the formation of shock in the divergent part. The behavior is different from what is observed for the liquid water phase in \sct{sec:liquid_nozzle} because of the liquid to gas density ratio that is of $1000$. Even though a shock forms, an exact solution at steady-state is still available \cite{nozzle_exact}. The objective of this section is to show that using the new definition of the viscosity coefficient in \eqt{eq:final_def_visc_coeff}, the shock can be correctly resolved without spurious oscillation. The steady-state numerical solution is shown in \fig{fig:1d_vap_nozzle} and was run with a mesh of $1600$ cells.

The steady-state solution of the density, Mach number and pressure are given in \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_vap_vel}, \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_vap_density} and \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_vap_press}. The steady-solution displays a shock around $x=0.8m$ and match the exact solution. In \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_vap_visc}, the first- and second-order viscosity coefficients are log plotted at steady-state: the second-order viscosity coefficient is peaked in the shock region around $x=0.8m$ as expected, and saturate to the first-order viscosity coefficient. The profile also displays another peak at $x=0.5m$ that corresponds to the position of the sonic point for a $1$-D convergent-divergent nozzle: this particular point is known to develop small instabilities that are detected when computing the jumps of the pressure and density gradients. Anywhere else, the second-order viscosity coefficient is small. In order to prove convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution, a convergence study is performed. Because of the presence of a shock, second-order accuracy cannot be achieved. However, the convergence rate of a numerical solution containing a shock  is known and expected to be of $1$ and $1/2$ when computing the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error, respectively (see Theorem 9.3 in \cite{convergence_book}). Results are reported in \tbl{tbl:l1_norm_vap} and \tbl{tbl:l2_norm_vap} for the primitive variables: density, velocity and pressure.

The convergence rates for the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error are close to the theoretical values which prove convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution.
%It is also interesting to investigate the effect of the first-order viscosity onto the steady-state solution. In \fig{fig:1d_nozzle_vap_fo_ev}, the steady-state velocity profile is plotted when using the first- and second-order viscosity coefficients: the main difference between the two numerical solution is in the resolution of the shock around $x=0.8m$. The first-order viscosity coefficient is by definition more dissipative and will smooth out the solution. In the other hand, the high-order viscosity better resolves the shock and allow high-order accuracy away from the shock region. It is also noted that the numerical solution obtained with the first-order viscosity coefficient is satisfying: this is due to the nature of the solution that contains a standing shock, and thus, will force the shock to form even with large artificial dissipation.

\subsection{Leblanc shock tube} \label{sec:Leblanc}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The $1$-D Leblanc shock tube is a Riemann problem designed to test the robustness and the accuracy of the stabilization method. The initial conditions are given in \tbl{tbl:ic_leblanc}. The ideal gas equation of state is used to compute the fluid pressure with the following heat capacity ratio $\gamma=5/3$.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
 \caption{\label{tbl:ic_leblanc} Initial conditions for the $1$-D Leblanc shock tube.}

  right & $10^{-3}$ & $0.$ & $10^{-7}$ \\

\end{tabular}

\end{table}
This test is computationally challenging because of the large left to right pressure ratio.
The computational domain consists of a $1$-D pipe of length $L=9m$ with an interface located at $x=2m$. At $t=0.s$, the interface is removed, allowing the fluid to move. The numerical solution is run until $t=4.s$ and the density, momentum and total energy profiles are given in \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_vel}, \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_density} and \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_press}, respectively, along with the exact solution. The viscosity coefficients are also plotted in \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_visc}. These plots were  run with three different uniform mesh of $800$, $3200$ and $6000$ cells and a constant time step $\Delta t = 10^{-3}s.$.

 The density, momentum and total energy profiles given in \fig{fig:1d_lebalnc} do not display any oscillations. In \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_density}, the shock region is zoomed in for better resolution: the shock is well resolved and do not show any oscillation. It is also observed that the shock position of the numerical solution converges to the exact position when refining the mesh. The contact wave is shown in \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_density} at $x=4.5m$. The second-order viscosity coefficient profile is shown in \fig{fig:1d_leblanc_visc} and behaves as expected: it saturates to the first-order viscosity in the shock region and thus prevent oscillations from forming. In the contact wave at $x=4.5m$, a smaller peak is observed that is due to the presence of the jumps in the definition of the second-order viscosity coefficient (\eqt{eq:final_def_visc_coeff}).  The Mach number is not plotted but is of the order of $1.3$ right before the shock and reaches a maximum value close to $5$ in the contact region.\\
 %For each plot in \fig{fig:1d_lebalnc}, the numerical solution run the first-order viscosity is also plotted: it is observed that the 
Once again, a convergence study is performed in order to prove convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution. As for the vapor phase in the $1$-D nozzle (\sct{sec:steam_nozzle}), the expected convergence rate for the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error are $1$ and $1/2$, respectively. The exact solution was obtained by running a $1$-D Riemann solver and used as a reference solution to compute the L$1$ and L$2$-norms of the error that are reported in \tbl{tbl:l1_norm_leblanc} and \tbl{tbl:l2_norm_leblanc} for the conservative variables: density, momentum and total energy.

\subsection{$1$-D shock tube for liquid phase} \label{sec:liquid_shock}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We want to investigate the capabilities of the entropy viscosity method to resolve strong shock for the liquid phase. This test is a preliminary work to the application of the entropy viscosity method to a two phase flow model. The Stiffened gas equation of state is used to model a liquid flow with the following parameters: $\gamma = 4.4$, $P_{\infty} = 6 \cdot 10^8$ $Pa$, $q = 0$ $J \cdot kg^{-1}$ and $Cv = 1000$ $J \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}$. The computational domain is of length $L=1$ $m$, discretized with an uniform mesh of $500$ cells, and the step initial conditions are given in \tbl{tbl:ic_strong_shock}.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
 \caption{\label{tbl:ic_strong_shock} Initial conditions for the $1$-D liquid shock tube.}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The simulation is run with a constant time step of $\Delta t = 10^{-7}$ $s$ until the final time $t_{final} = 7 \cdot 10^{-5}$ $s$. The plots of the pressure, the density, the velocity and the viscosity coefficients profiles are given in \fig{fig:1d_strong_shock} along with the exact solution for comparison.

        \caption{Numerical solution for the $1$-D liquid shock tube at  at $t_{final} = 7 \cdot 10^{-5}$ $s$.}\label{fig:1d_strong_shock}
\end{figure}
The numerical solution does not display any oscillations and match the exact solution in \fig{fig:1d_strong_shock_var}. The viscosity coefficients $\mu$ and $\kappa$ are not equal in the shock because the Mach number is of order $0.1$. The viscosity coefficient $\kappa$ saturate to the first-order viscosity in the shock region around $x = 0.65$ $m$ and seems sufficient to stabilize the numerical scheme. This example illustrates the capabilities of the entropy viscosity method to stabilize a strong shock.

\subsection{$1$-D slow moving shock} \label{sec:slow_moving_shock}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A $1$-D slow moving shock (\cite{james}) is simulated with the entropy viscosity method. It consist of a shock wave moving from left to right with the initial conditions given in \tbl{tbl:ic_slow_moving}. The Ideal Gas equation of state is used with a heat capacity ratio, $\gamma$, of $1.1$. Note that assuming a Courant number of $1$, it takes up to $50$ time steps for the shock to traverse on mesh cell. In order to make the shock travel a significant distance, the final time is taken equal to $t=1.1s$. Then, a pressure boundary condition is used at the left boundary to let the rarefaction and contact waves exit the domain.   
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
 \caption{\label{tbl:ic_slow_moving} Initial conditions for a $1$-D slow moving shock.}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\nonumber
\end{table}
A slow moving shock is known to produce post-shock noise of low frequency that are not damped by some numerical dissipation methods (\cite{james}). The objective, here, is to see wether or not the entropy viscosity method is capable of damping the low frequency waves. Numerical results are given in \fig{fig:low_moving_shock} and are compared to the exact solution obtained from a Riemann solver. 
\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering

        \end{subfigure} 
        \caption{Slow moving shock profiles at $t=1.1s$.}\label{fig:low_moving_shock}
\end{figure} 
The numerical results show good agreement with the exact solution and do not display any post shock noise. As explained in \cite{roberts}, Godunov's type method usually fails to resolve a slow moving shock because of the nature of the stabilization method that is proportional to the eigenvalue. In the case under consideration, the shock is moving slowly which underestimate the dissipation. In the case of the entropy viscosity method, the entropy residual detects the shock position and the normalization parameter makes the high-order viscosity coefficients saturate to the first-order viscosity that is proportional to the local maximum eigenvalue $||\vec{u}||+c$. The rarefaction and contact waves are not on \fig{fig:profiles_sms} since they exited the computational domain through the left pressure boundary condition.

\subsection{Subsonic flow over a $2$-D cylinder} \label{sec:cylinder}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The flow of a fluid over a $2$-D cylinder is a typical benchmark case to test the behavior of a numerical method in the low Mach regime. For this test, an analytical solution is available in the incompressible limit or low Mach limit (REFS) and often referred to as potential flow. The main features of the potential flow are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The solution is symmetric: the iso-mach number lines are used to asses the symmetry of the numerical solution.
\item The velocity at the top of the cylinder is twice the incoming velocity set at the inlet.
\item The pressure fluctuations are proportional to the inlet Mach number square as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{P} = \frac{\max(P) - \min(P)}{\max(P)}  \propto M_{\infty}^2\nonumber
%||\tilde{\vec{u}}|| = \frac{\max(||\vec{u}||) - \min(||\vec{u}||)}{\max(||\vec{u}||)}  \propto M_{\infty}\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tilde{P}$ and $M_{\infty}$ are the pressure fluctuations and the inlet Mach number, respectively.
\end{itemize}
The computational domain consists of a $1\times 1$ square with a circular hole of radius $0.05$ in its middle. At the inlet, a subsonic stagnation boundary condition is used: the stagnation pressure and temperature are computed using the following relations, valid for the Stiffened and Ideal gas equation of states:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stagnation_relations}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
P_0 = P\left( 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2} M^2 \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} \\
T_0 = T\left( 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2} M^2 \right)
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
The static pressure $P_s = 101325$ $Pa$ is set at the subsonic outlet and a static pressure boundary type is used. The implementation of the pressure boundary conditions is done on the model of \cite{SEM}. A solid wall boundary condition is set for the top and bottom walls of the computational domain: the normal velocity is zero since no mass can penetrate the solid body. The mesh is made of triangular cells.\\
The steady-state for Mach numbers ranging from $M_{\infty} = 10^{-3}$ to $M_{\infty} = 10^{-7}$ is shown in \fig{fig:cylinder}. The iso-Mach lines are drawn with $30$ intervals ranging from $2 \cdot 10^{-10}$ to $2M_{\infty}$, and allow to assess the symmetry of the numerical solution.

In \tbl{tbl:velocity_ratio}, the velocity at the top of the cylinder and at the inlet are given for the different values of the Mach number presented in \fig{fig:cylinder}. The ratio of the inlet velocity to the velocity at the top of cylinder is also computed and is very close to $2$ as expected.

In \fig{fig:pressure_vel_fluc}, the pressure and velocity fluctuations are plotted as a function of the far field Mach number, on a log-log plot. The pressure and velocity fluctuations are expected to be of the order of the Mach number square and the Mach number, respectively. It is known that some stabilization methods, alike upwind scheme \cite{guillard}, can produce pressure fluctuations with the wrong order. The objective of \fig{fig:pressure_vel_fluc} is to show that the new definition of the viscosity coefficients yields the correct order in the low Mach limit for both the pressure and velocity variables. For reference purpose, the function $f(M) = M^2$ and $f(M)=M$ are plotted.

\caption{Log-log plot of the pressure and velocity fluctuations as a function of the far field Mach number.}

\end{figure}
It is noted that the velocity fluctuations yields the correct order of convergence as a function of the Mach number for all simulations. In another hand, the pressure fluctuations only display a slope of $2$ until $M_{\infty} = 10^{-7}$.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Subsonic flow over a $2$-D hump} \label{sec:hump}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a another example of an internal flow configuration. It consist of a channel of height $L=1$ $m$ and length $3L$, with a circular bump of length $L$ and thickness $0.1L$. The bump is located on the bottom wall at a distance $L$ from the inlet. The system is initialized with an uniform pressure $P=101325$ $Pa$ and temperature $T=300$ $K$. The initial velocity is computed from the Mach number, $M_{\infty}$, the pressure, the temperature and the Ideal Gas equation of state with the heat capacity $C_v = 717$ $J/kg-K$ and the heat capacity ratio $\gamma=1.4$. At the inlet, a subsonic stagnation boundary condition is used and the stagnation pressure and temperature are computed using \eqt{eq:stagnation_relations}.
The static pressure $P_s = 101325$ $Pa$ is set at the subsonic outlet. An uniform grid is used to get the numerical solution until steady-state is reached. The results are shown in \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p7}, \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p01}, \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p0001} and \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p0000001} for the inlet Mach numbers $M_{\infty}=0.7$, $M_{\infty}=0.01$, $M_{\infty}=10^{-4}$ and $M_{\infty}=10^{-7}$, respectively. It is expected that, within the low Mach number range, the solution does not depend on the Mach number and is identical to the solution obtained with an incompressible flow code. On the other hand, for a flow at $M=0.7$, the compressible effects become more important and shock can form.

\end{figure}
The results showed in \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p01}, \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p0001} and \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p0000001} correspond to the low Mach regime. The iso-Mach lines are drawn ranging from the minimum and the maximum of each legend with 50 intervals. The steady-state solution is symmetric and does not depend on the value of the inlet Mach number as expected. \\
In \fig{fig:2d_hump_mach_0p7}, the steady-state numerical solution develops a shock: the compressibility effect are no longer negligible. The iso-Mach lines are also plotted with $50$ intervals and ranging from $0.4$ to $1.6$. The shock is well resolved and does not display any instability or spurious oscillation. \\
The results presented in \fig{fig:2d_hump} were obtained with the new definition of the viscosity coefficient (see \eqt{eq:final_def_visc_coeff}), and, illustrate the capabilities of the entropy-viscosity method to adapt to the type of flow (subsonic and transonic flows) without using any tuning parameters, but by just evaluating the entropy residual that is an indicator of the entropy production.    
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Supersonic flow in a compression corner} \label{sec:corner}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an example of a supersonic flow over a wedge of angle $15^{\circ}$ where an oblique shock is generated at steady-state. The Mach number upstream of the shock is fixed to $M=2.5$. The initial conditions are uniform: the pressure and temperature are set to $P=101325$ $Pa$ and $T=300$ $K$, respectively. The initial velocity is computed from the upstream Mach number and using the Ideal Gas equation of state with the same parameters as in \sct{sec:hump}. The code is run until steady-state. From the oblique shock theory \cite{CompressionCorner}, an analytical solution for this supersonic flow is available and give the downstream to upstream pressure, entropy and Mach number ratios. The analytical and numerical ratios are given in \tbl{tbl:corner_exact_sol}, and are very close. The shock wave angle at steady-state is also known and given by the so-called $\theta -\beta -M$ relation:
\begin{equation}
\tan \theta = 2 \cot \beta \frac{M^2 \sin^2 \beta -1}{M^2 \left(\gamma+\cos^2 (2\beta)\right)+2} \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\theta$, $\beta$ and $M$ denote the wedge angle, the shock wave angle and the upstream Mach number, respectively. For the example under consideration with an inlet Mach number of $2.5$, the exact value of the shock wave angle is of $36.94^{\circ}$ at steady-state. From \fig{fig:2d_corner_mach}, the numerical value of the shock wave angle can be measured and is found equal to $36.9^{\circ}$: the numerical and exact values are very close.

The inlet is supersonic and therefore, the pressure, temperature and velocity are specified using Dirichlet boundary conditions. The outlet is also supersonic and none of the characteristics enter the domain through this boundary: the values will be computed by the implicit solver.

The steady-state numerical solution is given in \fig{fig:2d_corner}: the Mach number, the viscosity coefficients are plotted in \fig{fig:2d_corner_mach} and \fig{fig:2d_corner_visc}, respectively. The steady-state solution is formed of two regions of constant states, separated by the oblique shock. In \fig{fig:2d_corner_visc}, the viscosity coefficient is large in the shock, small anywhere else, and thus, behaves as expected. At the corner of the edge at $x=-0.25$ $m$, the viscosity coefficient is peaked because of the treatment of the wall boundary condition: at this particular node, the normal is not well defined and can cause numerical errors. The $1$-D plots of the pressure and the mach number at $y=0$, are also given in \fig{fig:2d_corner_isomach}: the shock does not show any spurious oscillations and is well resolved. Finally, the difference between the inlet and outlet mass flow rates is plotted in \fig{fig:2d_convergence} and show that the steady-state is reached. \\
Overall, the numerical solution does not show any oscillations, match the analytical solution, and the shock is well resolved.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:ccl}
A new version of the entropy viscosity method valid for a wide range of Mach number and applied to the multi-D Euler equations with variable area was derived and presented. The definition of the viscosity coefficient is now consistent with the low Mach asymptotic limit, does not require an analytical expression of the entropy function, and thus, could be used with any equation of state having a convex entropy. Tests were performed with the Ideal and Stiffened Gas equation of states. In $1$-D, convergence of the numerical solution (either smooth or with shocks) to the exact solution was demonstrated by computing the convergence rates of the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error for flows in convergence-divergent nozzle and a straight pipe. $2$-D simulations were also performed for both subsonic and supersonic flows, and various geometries: the entropy viscosity method behaves well for a wide range of Mach number. The numerical results obtained for a flow over a circular bump (subsonic and transonic flows) illustrates the capabilities of the method to adapt to the flow type. \\
As future work, the entropy viscosity method will be extended to the $1$-D seven equations model \cite{SEM}. This two-phase flow system of equations is a good candidate for two reasons: it is unconditionally hyperbolic and degenerates to the multi-D Euler equations when one phase disappears.

\appendix
\section{Derivation of the entropy residual as a function of the density, the pressure and the speed of sound:} \label{app:ent_res}
The entropy residual is often expressed as a function of the entropy $s(\vec{r},t)$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
D_e(\vec{r},t) = \partial_t s (\vec{r},t) + \vec{u} \cdot \div s (\vec{r},t) \nonumber
\end{equation}
where all variables were defined previously. This form of the entropy residual is not suitable for the low-Mach limit as explained in \sct{sec:background}. It can be shown that the entropy residual $D_e(\vec{r},t)$ can be recast as a function of the primitive variables (pressure, velocity and density) and the speed of sound. This is the objective of this appendix. \\
The first step is to use the chain rule, remembering that the entropy is assumed function of the internal energy $e$ and the density $\rho$:
\begin{equation}
D_e(\vec{r},t) = s_e \frac{d e}{dt} + s_{\rho} \frac{d \rho}{dt} \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $s_x$ denotes the partial derivative of $s$ with respect to the variable $x$. The short-notation $\frac{d \cdot}{dt}$ is used for the total or material derivative. We now need to make the pressure appear: this can be achieved by noticing that the internal energy is a function of the pressure and the density based on the definition of the equation of state. Once again, by using the chain rule, it yields:
\begin{eqnarray}
D_e(\vec{r},t) &=&  s_e e_P \frac{d P}{dt} + ( s_e e_{\rho} + s_{\rho} ) \frac{d \rho}{dt} \nonumber \\
&=& s_e e_P \left( \frac{d P}{dt} + \frac{1}{s_e e_P} ( s_e e_{\rho} + s_{\rho} ) \frac{d \rho}{dt} \right) \nonumber \\
&=& s_e e_P \left( \frac{d P}{dt} + ( \frac{e_{\rho}}{e_P} + \frac{s_{\rho}}{s_e e_P} ) \frac{d \rho}{dt} \right) \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
We are now close to the final result (see \eqt{eq:ent_res}). It remains to prove that the term multiplying the material derivative of the density is equal to the speed of sound square. The speed of sound is often defined as the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to the density at constant entropy, which can be recast as a function of the entropy as follows (see Appendix A.2 of \cite{jlg}):
\begin{equation}
c^2 = \left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} \right)_s = P_{\rho} - \frac{s_{\rho}}{s_e} P_e = - \frac{e_{\rho}}{e_P} - \frac{s_{\rho}}{s_e e_P} \nonumber
\end{equation}
using the following relations (see Appendix A.1 of \cite{jlg}):
\begin{equation}
P_e = \frac{1}{e_P} \text{ and } P_{\rho} = -\frac{e_{\rho}}{e_P} \nonumber
\end{equation}
Then, the result follows.

\section{Derivation of the dissipative terms for the multi-D Euler equations with variable area using the entropy minimum principle:} \label{app:diss_terms}
The multi-D Euler equations with variable area are recalled here:
\begin{equation}
\label{app:euler_variable_A}
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{lll}
\partial_t \left( \rho A \right) + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) = 0 \\
\partial_t \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) + \div \left[A\left( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u} + P \mathbf{I} \right) \right] = P \grad A \\
\partial_t \left( \rho E \right) + \div \left[ \vec{u} \left( \rho E + P \right) \right] = 0
\end{array}
\right. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Assuming the existence of an entropy $s$ function of the density $\rho$ and the internal energy $e$, the above system of equations admits the following entropy residual \cite{Toro}:
\begin{equation}
A \rho \left( \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \div s \right) \geq 0 \nonumber \\
\end{equation}
when assuming $Ps_e + \rho^2 s_{\rho} =0$. An entropy function $s$ verifying this equation is also a solution of the second thermodynamic law for a reversible system, $T ds = de - \frac{P}{\rho^2} d \rho$, which implies $s_e = T^{-1} \geq 0$. \\
In order to apply the entropy viscosity method, dissipative terms are added to each equation. Then, the entropy residual is derived again: extra terms due to the dissipative terms will appear in the left-hand side. In order to prove the minimum entropy principle, these extra terms are either recast as conservative term, or shown to be positive. \\ 
The multi-D Euler equations with variable area with dissipative terms, yield:
\begin{equation}
\label{app:euler_variable_A_diss}
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{lll}
\partial_t \left( \rho A \right) + \div \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) = \div f \\
\partial_t \left( \rho \vec{u} A \right) + \div \left[A\left( \rho \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u} + P \mathbf{I} \right) \right] = P \grad A + \div g \\
\partial_t \left( \rho E \right) + \div \left[ \vec{u} \left( \rho E + P \right) \right] = \div h
\end{array}
\right. 
\end{equation}
where $f$, $g$ and $h$ are the dissipative terms to derive. Starting from the modified system of equations given in \eqt{app:euler_variable_A_diss}, the entropy residual is derived again:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ent_res_app}
A \rho \left( \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \div s \right) &=& s_e \left[ \div h + g \grad u + \left( \frac{u^2}{2}-e \right) \div f \right] \nonumber\\
&+& \rho s_{\rho} \div f
\end{eqnarray}
The next step consists of choosing a definition for each of the dissipative terms so that the left hand-side is proven positive. The right hand-side of \eqt{eq:ent_res_app} can be simplified using the following relations, $g = A \mu \grad^s \vec{u} + \vec{u} \otimes f$ and $h = \tilde{h} + \vec{u} \cdot g - 0.5 || \vec{u} ||^2 f$, which yields:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ent_res_app2}
A \rho \left( \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \div s \right) &=& s_e \left[ \div \tilde{h}-e \div f \right] + \rho s_{\rho} \div f  + A s_e \mu \grad \vec{u}^s \grad \vec{u}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The right hand-side is now integrated by parts:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ent_res_app3}
A \rho \left( \partial_t s + \vec{u} \cdot \div s \right) &=& \div \left[ s_e \tilde{h}-s_e e f  + \rho s_{\rho} f \right] -\nonumber \\
\div \tilde{h} \grad s_e  &-& f \grad (e s_e) -  f \grad ( \rho s_{\rho} ) + A s_e \mu \grad \vec{u}^s \grad \vec{u} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\grad^s$ is the symmetric gradient. The term $A s_e \mu \grad \vec{u}^s \grad \vec{u}$ is positive and thus, does not need any further modification. It remains to treat the other terms of the right hand-side that we now call $rhs$:
\begin{equation}
rhs = \div \left[ s_e \tilde{h}-s_e e f  + \rho s_{\rho} f \right] - \tilde{h} \grad s_e  - f \grad (e s_e) - f \grad ( \rho s_{\rho} ) \nonumber
\end{equation}
The first term of $rhs$ is a conservative terms. By choosing carefully a definition for $\tilde{h}$ and $f$, the conservative term can be expressed as a function of the entropy $s$. It is also required to include the variable area in the choice of the dissipative terms so that when assuming constant area, the regular multi-D Euler equations are recovered. The following definitions for $\tilde{h}$ and $f$ are chosen:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{h} = A \kappa \grad ( \rho e ) \text{ and } f = A \kappa \grad \rho, \nonumber 
\end{equation}
which yields, using the chain rule:
\begin{equation}
rhs = \div (\tcr{\rho} A \kappa \grad s ) - A \kappa \underbrace{\left[ \grad (\rho e) \grad s_e  + \grad \rho \grad (e s_e) +  \grad \rho \grad ( \rho s_{\rho} )  \right]}_{\mathbf{Q}} \nonumber
\end{equation}
It remains to treat the term $\mathbf{Q}$ that can be recast under a quadratic form, following the work done in \cite{jlg}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{Q} &=& X^t \Sigma X \nonumber \\
\text{with } X &=& \begin{bmatrix}
\grad \rho \\
\grad e 
\end{bmatrix}
\text{and } \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
       \partial_{\rho} (\rho^2 \partial_{\rho} s) & \partial_{\rho,e} s  \\[0.3em]
       \partial_{\rho,e} s & \partial_{e,e} s           \\[0.3em]
     \end{bmatrix} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
The matrix $\Sigma$ is symmetric and identical to the matrix obtained in \cite{jlg}. The sign of the quadratic form can be simply determined by studying the positiveness of the matrix $\Sigma$. In this particular case, it is required to prove that the matrix is negative definite: the quadratic form is in the right hand-side and is preceded of a negative sign. According to \cite{jlg}, the convexity of the opposite of the entropy function $s$ with respect to the internal energy $e$ and the specific volume $1/ \rho$ is sufficient to ensure that the matrix $\Sigma$ is negative definite. \\
Thus, the right hand-side of the entropy residual \eqt{eq:ent_res_app}, are now either recast as conservative terms, or known to be positive. Following the work done by \cite{jlg}, the entropy minimum principle holds.

\section{Entropy residual with an isentropic equations of state:} \label{app:ise_equ}
This appendix aims at showing that the entropy residual is null when assuming an isentropic flow. \\
The entropy residual as a function of the pressure, the density, the velocity and the speed of sound is recalled here:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_entr}
\tilde{D}_e = \frac{dP}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt}
\end{equation}
Assuming an isentropic flow, the pressure is only a function of the density as follows: $P = f( \rho )$ or $\rho = f^{-1}( P )$. Using the definition of the speed of sound $c^2 = \left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} \right)_s$ and the above form the equation of state, the following relation is derived:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_sp}
c^2 = \left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} \right)_s = \frac{d P}{d \rho} = \frac{d f(\rho)}{d \rho}
\end{equation}
Using the chain rule, the entropy residual of \eqt{eq:app_entr} can be recast as a function of the density, the velocity and the speed of sound, and proven equal to zero:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{D}_e &=& \frac{d f(\rho)}{d \rho} \frac{d\rho}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt} \nonumber\\
\tilde{D}_e &=& c^2 \frac{d\rho}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt} \nonumber\\
\tilde{D}_e &=&  0 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
