Thank you for the latest review of our manuscript and your appreciation for the high-quality of our work.

Please find attached  a revised version of our manuscript entitled
``Entropy-based viscous regularization for the multi-dimensional Euler equations in low-Mach and transonic flows''
by M. Delchini, J. Ragusa, and R. Berry for
publication in Computers \& Fluids. We appreciate the comments of the reviewer as we
believe they have allowed us to improve the paper.

We have attached a file of detailed responses for the new Reviewer \#3.
