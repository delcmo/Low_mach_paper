This looks like it a revised manuscript modified on the basis of oneextensive review.This work is largely derivative of the work of Geurmond and Popov andproduces a reasonable extension of their work. The revision is largelysuccessful per the comments of that reviewer. A few issue remainunaddressed and I will highlight these below.

1. In the introduction the description of the stabilization methodsavailable for hyperbolic PDEs is a bit pedestrian. There are dissipationapproaches typified by artificial viscosity and Riemann solvers, and"limiters" associated with high-order discretizations. Both are important,but they are quite different. Two major themes exist (Van 2006 coversthis topic well, as well as Zalesak 1997).Van Leer, B. (2006). Upwind and high-resolution methods forcompressible flow: From donor cell to residual-distribution schemes.Communications in Computational Physics, 1(192-206), 12.Zalesak, Steven T. "Introduction to "Flux-corrected transport. I. SHASTA,a fluid transport algorithm that works"." Journal of Computational Physics135.2 (1997): 170-171.}

2. The connections to the work of Cook and Cabot seem to be verystrong. These should be mentioned and examined.Cook, Andrew W., and William H. Cabot. "Hyperviscosity for shockturbulenceinteractions." Journal of Computational Physics 203.2 (2005):379-385.Cook, Andrew W., and William H. Cabot. "A high-wavenumber viscosityfor high-resolution numerical methods." Journal of Computational Physics195.2 (2004): 594-601.Fiorina, Benoit, and Sanjiva K. Lele. "An artificial nonlinear diffusivitymethod for supersonic reacting flows with shocks." Journal ofComputational Physics 222.1 (2007): 246-264.}

3. I'm surprised that Lax's work on vanishing viscosity is never mentionednor the numerical impact of it.Lax, Peter D. Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and themathematical theory of shock waves. Vol. 11. SIAM, 1973.Harten, Amiram, et al. "On finite?difference approximations and entropyconditions for shocks." Communications on pure and applied mathematics29.3 (1976): 297-322. 
}

We added the two above references to the introduction. Thank you for pointing this out.

4. The issue of maintaining high-order accuracy does not matter onceshocks are formed. (second-order barely meets this condition!). Theaccuracy drops to 1st order with shocks, and lower if the wave is linearlydiscontinuous. I find the reference here to be odd and suggest usingsomething more classical in the shock community.Majda, Andrew, and Stanley Osher. "Propagation of error into regions ofsmoothness for accurate difference approximations to hyperbolicequations." Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics 30.6(1977): 671-705.Banks, Jeffrey W., T. Aslam, and W. J. Rider. "On sub-linear convergencefor linearly degenerate waves in capturing schemes." Journal ofComputational Physics 227.14 (2008): 6985-7002.
}

Thank you for pointing out the above references to us that we found vey interesting. We added these references to the paper in the numerical results section.

5. The bounding viscosity is actually larger than upwind, it is Rusunov orLocal Lax-Friedrichs viscosity determined by the largest wave speed in thesystem. This could become very large and potentially damaging as theflow becomes low-Mach. Is this problem encountered? Or is it mitigated?This would seem to be a major potential problem with the formulation.Most of the time the dissipation proportional to the material velocitywould seem to be the relevant one for the dynamics.
}

This is correct and we thank the reviewer for this comment.

6. It would be good to see some modification and improvement of themethod in this paper. I only see an extension to low-Mach flows.
}

The method was improved in two ways. First, the definition of the viscosity coefficients no longer require a function form of the entropy function and thus, can be used with a wide range of equation of states and table look-ups. Second, the definition of the viscosity coefficients was extended to transonic and subsonic flows.

7. I find the quality of the line plots to be quite poor and not up to thestandards of publication. These should be improved.
}

We improved the quality of the 2-D plots that are presented in the section called numerical results.

8. For the final few examples a more quantitative assessment of thenumerical accuracy and order of convergence of the method would bequite welcome.
